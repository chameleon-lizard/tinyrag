You will obviously get to know your professors and fellow students in the next few weeks, but you should also probably know who runs the university on the administrative side. You know, just to have an idea. Skoltech was founded by the top Russian companies and leading institutes. Among them are VEB.RF, Sber, MIPT, New Economic School, Moscow School of Management.The Founders are entitled to approve the Charter, establish the Institute's governance bodies, and appoint the Board of Trustees. You can read more about the Founders below. Honored academics, statesmen and businessmen make up the Board of Trustees. Members of the Board set and hold Skoltech accountable for following its strategies, as well as oversee the development of the university. The final key player of the Skoltech government bodies is the Student Council, whose role is to voice student needs to the university administration. Each year, students elect the Council and its President, Vice President and Coordinator to represent you over the course of the next academic year. You will learn more about the Student Council\u2019s role and activities in the next module.Meanwhile, let\u2019s see what happens behind the scenes of the day-to-day management\\! Below you will see Skoltech\u2019s current leadership team . It consists of the University President and Provost, as well as several Vice Presidents and Deans responsible for different areas of the university\u2019s management. You will get to know team members and leaders of these departments as you attend Skoltech events throughout your time here. Skoltech\u2019s research and education activities revolve around several target domains: \n\n* Artificial Intelligence & Telecommunications  \n* Cutting-edge Engineering, Advanced Materials  \n* Photonics  \n* Life Sciences & Health, Agro  \n* Energy Efficiency & ESG  \n* Advanced Studies\n\n*Text Overlay: **several target domains**:* \n\n* *Artificial Intelligence & Telecommunications*  \n* *Cutting-edge Engineering, Advanced Materials*  \n* *Photonics*  \n* *Life Sciences & Health, Agro*  \n* *Energy Efficiency & ESG*  \n* *Advanced Studies*\n\nBy the way, management doesn\u2019t cover just academics and research, right? There are entire departments responsible for cooperation with industry, communications and student affairs. For instance, you will most likely hear from these people quite often: \n\n* Education Department \u2014 about your academic affairs, curriculum and more  \n* Student Department \u2014 about student activities, benefits, scholarships and more  \n* Accommodation team \u2014 if you\u2019re living in the dorms, you will get to know the housing team pretty well:)\n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n- *Education Department*   \n- *Student Department*  \n- *Accommodation team* \n\nFinally, the people you will interact the most with are members of your Centers and Programs.

A Policy is an official document passed by Skoltech\u2019s leadership team to optimize the university\u2019s functions and/or activities. For instance, you can hear something like \u201cSkoltech Policy on Student Scholarships and Other Benefits\u201d or \u201cSkoltech\u2019s IP policy\u201d, which, btw, you will learn about in the next modules. The policies don\u2019t just appear out of thin air: their formation is a long process that involves all the leadership and representative parties of Skoltech you\u2019ve read about already. That includes the students, too. In fact, before a policy is drafted, **Skoltech makes sure to give the students the opportunity to voice their concerns or opinions** on the issue in question through the Student Council. You can also participate in working groups and contribute your feedback any time. So this way, you the students are quite literally the policy makers of the institute\\! *Text Overlay: Feedback and freedom for exploration*\n\nFinally, Skoltech is a young university. That means you, as part of the growing community, have an opportunity to shape its values and mission. One way to do that is through feedback, and here we want to stress that **your feedback and participation in university-wide initiatives is crucial** to strengthening Skoltech as an international community of scientists every day. As a student, you have incredible freedom to explore your passions, try your hand in different subject areas and even work-related activities. This university was literally built to open your abilities and your mind, to help you reach for incredible goals and achieve them. The growth of our community and university wouldn\u2019t be possible without your input. Please keep that in mind as you dive into your academic year and the next lessons of this orientation course. Embrace the opportunities that come your way, and get the most out of them while you are still here.

Here\u2019s a quick timeline: \n\n*Graph:* \n\n![][image11]\n\nSide note:  Short-term projects follow regular registration schedule\n\nSo how do you register for your courses?As we\u2019ve already mentioned, you do not need to register for any courses in Term 1A \\- you are already signed up for a compulsory course called Innovation Workshop. Instructions on how to register for the other terms will be sent to you individually by the Education Department. Meanwhile, you can explore [the courses offered in 2022-2023](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/course-catalog/) (and in the upcoming terms) [using the link below](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/course-catalog/) and choose which ones you want to register for. You can filter courses based on your program, credit load, and instructors. After you\u2019ve registered for courses, you will be added to your course \u201cpage\u201d on Canvas. Here you will see information about your registered courses, your grades, assignments, group work and more. Make sure to bookmark Canvas in your browser and check it for updates from your professors and program coordinators on a daily basis\\! As a student, you have rights and channels for feedback. As Skoltech constantly works on improving this communication, please be aware of the following:\n\nYour student rights:\n\n* To obtain full information on your courses and educational programs, course syllabi, assessment criteria and feedback on your progress  \n* To provide your feedback on the quality of courses\n\n At the end of each course, you will be asked to submit a formal evaluation of the coursework, the course load and your professor, course instructor and teaching assistant. These evaluations are used to collect your *anonymous* feedback on each of your learning experiences. The feedback is then followed-up to Education Department, course instructors and program coordinators. If you need to communicate any concerns or issues informally or outside of the formal evaluation period (or if you are unable to solve an issue directly with your research advisor or faculty, please talk to the [Education Department](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/21) \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0432 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438. If you are a student of a network or a joint program, you probably have a few questions about the logistics of your studies. *Text Overlay: Network and Joint Programs and double degrees*\n\nYour schedule, curriculum and even travel times will depend on the program you are in. Moreover, there will be specific regulations on how to submit your original diploma and receive your scholarship if you are a student of a joint or network program. The details of your studies are normally coordinated by the Centers to which your programs belong. Each program has its own *coordinator*, who will be in touch with you regarding the essential information (if they haven\u2019t reached out yet). Until then, if you have urgent questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the Education Department via [education@skoltech.ru](mailto:education@skoltech.ru).

Remember that the shuttle buses at Skolkovo have paid fares (same as within the Moscow public transportation system, we\u2019ll talk about that in the next modules) and can be tracked via [Yandex maps](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10)\n\nBy the way, the Skolkovo Innovation Center website also has some tips on how to reach other buildings on the territory.

All you need to do is download a relevant app to your smartphone, order a taxi to Skoltech (just type \u201c\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0445\u201d in the destination, it will be there) and relax. Don\u2019t forget to buckle up\\! If you take a different taxi service, you\u2019ll need to order a territory pass ahead of time. To order a pass for your taxi, email security.campus@skoltech.ru from your Skoltech email address with your taxi\u2019s model and license number (i.e. Toyota, \u0425111\u0421\u041a197).",

If you ask for a monthly pass, you\u2019ll need to *renew it every month* via email. Next, you\u2019ll need to find a parking spot because you can park only in designated parking lots. Wait, let us stress that again: if you park your car anywhere *besides* a parking lot, it will be towed and your access to the Skolkovo Innovation Center territory will be restricted\u2026 *forever*\\! A current list of all Skolkovo parking lots is published on [sta-parking.ru (links to an external site).](https://www.sta-parking.ru/) (RUS). ![][image9]\n\n \n\nIn terms of parking prices, parking is free for 2 hours and then 50 RUB per hour. Spaces are pretty limited, though. To secure a spot and entry in the long-term, you can email Clients@sta-parking.ru. Monthly parking plans start at 5000 RUB/month. Finally, you can also park outside of the Skolkovo territory. You can try the [Tri Kita Mall parking lot (links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/org/tri\\_kita/1112120378/?indoorLevel=1\\&ll=37.355723%2C55.702835\\&z=17.03) or near the [\u201cInnovatsya\u201d apartments (links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?indoorLevel=1\\&ll=37.355723%2C55.702835\\&mode=poi\\&poi%5Bpoint%5D=37.357476%2C55.700718\\&poi%5Buri%5D=ymapsbm1%3A%2F%2Forg%3Foid%3D191529528774\\&z=17.03), but spaces there are not guaranteed. **Carsharing is another option.** \n\nA great option for transportation without the upkeep fees, are we right? Carsharing services [BelkaCar (links to an external site)](https://belkacar.ru/) and [DeliMobil (links to an external site)](https://delimobil.ru/) have access to the Skolkovo territory with some parking options around the territory. If you choose to use a different car sharing service, you may need to search for a different parking option outside of the Skolkovo Innovation Center Territory (for example, there is an \u201cexternal\u201d parking lot just behind the Skoltech campus that\u2019s not part of the Skolkovo infrastructure). In that case, we suggest looking for an \u201cend destination\u201d spot ahead of time. *Phew, we\u2019re almost there:)*\n\nAre you up for a scooter or a bike ride? The Skolkovo territory has lots of electric scooter and bike stations where you can rent one from March to November (watch out for puddles\\!). For instance, there is a bike/scooter stop right outside of the MCD Skolkovo station so you can start your day with a breeze. To rent one of these sweet rides, scan a QR code on the vehicle and follow the instructions.

First, you need to find a potential research advisor and propose your thesis topic to them by January of your first year. You should then have some development on it done by Terms 3 or 4 of your first year. Then you work on it every term in your second year, with the proposal complete no later than October of your second year. Your status review presentations should be done in the Winter Term of your second year. Then it\u2019s onto the thesis draft and pre-defenses by May of your second year, and a final defense in June of your second year. Right now, you don\u2019t need to worry about securing your research topic or anything like that. However, we know from experience that one of the keys to success in your MSc Thesis Project is selecting the right advisor. So, here are a few tips:\n\n- Take classes from different instructors and spend time getting to know them  \n- Gather feedback from older MSc and PhD students about their experience  \n- Try to participate in the lab work of several different labs  \n- Keep an open mind, even if you\u2019ve already decided who who want to work with  \n- Pay attention to how you work together, not just chat after class.

Academic mobility allows a student\u2019s immersion into a worldwide ecosystem of science, research and innovations and provides a unique opportunity: \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. Now, you may ask: who can apply for academic mobility or an academic trip? It could be students who show outstanding academic performance, have a Skoltech research advisor and a preliminarily defined MS thesis project. There are two academic mobility options:   \nFirst \\- Short-term trips to conferences of workshops\n\n*Text Overlay: Short-term trips to conferences of workshops*\n\nThis opportunity usually becomes available when first results of research work emerge, i.e. Term 1 \u2013 3 are completed. An applying student should be active and contributing participant of the event, presenting a paper or a poster. If you learn about an event you want to participate in, discuss it with your advisor or reach out your program coordinator and contactEducation Department to get further instructions and support. Second option \\- Long-term academic mobility\n\n*Text Overlay: Long-term academic mobility*\n\nThese trips are aimed to allow thesis research at highly ranked institutions and recognized research labs around the world. Skoltech competitively selects students\u2019 proposals and provides supporting grants for the approved academic trips. The selection is primarily based on the students\u2019 motivation and justification provided, showing how a trip contributes to the students\u2019 overall educational experience and path. Skoltech also looks at how a proposed mobility opportunity enables students to complete their degree at Skoltech and achieve their post-graduation career goals. The competition process includes primary screening by Education Department and assessment by the Programs. The call for applications is usually announced after Term 3 and the winning applicants schedule their trips to Term 6 \u2013 7\\.

Even if not, every program dedicates time for students' independent research as part of your academic plan. *Text Overlay: Research Areas Overview*\n\nSkoltech hosts more than 25 world-class laboratories based in Centers for Research, Education and Innovation (CREIs) established in collaboration with international and Russian Partners. Students have full access to the facilities throughout their studies and can conduct research based on their interests in IT, Biomedicine, Energy, Space, Cross Cutting Science. As part of your MSc Thesis project, you will develop very specific studies that go deep into one of the following topics: \n\n- Molecular and Cellular Biology  \n- Agro Technologies  \n- Neurobiology and Brain Rehabilitation  \n- Artificial Intelligence Technology  \n- Energy Science and Technology  \n- Petroleum Science and Engineering  \n- Materials Technologies  \n- Digital Engineering  \n- Advanced Studies  \n- Photonic Science and Engineering  \n- Engineering Physics  \n- Materials Science\n\n*Text Overlay:*  \n\n- *Molecular and Cellular Biology*  \n- *Agro Technologies*  \n- *Neurobiology and Brain Rehabilitation*  \n- *Artificial Intelligence Technology*  \n- *Energy Science and Technology*  \n- *Petroleum Science and Engineering*  \n- *Materials Technologies*  \n- *Digital Engineering*  \n- *Advanced Studies*  \n- *Photonic Science and Engineering*  \n- *Engineering Physics*  \n- *Materials Science* \n\nYour research advisor will most likely be a part of the relevant laboratory and CREI.

And one place to find them is at the Skoltech Library. The Skoltech library is not only about books for loan, it is an academic hub for learning outside a classroom and doing research outside a lab. It combines digital infrastructure and a self-directed learning space located on the third floor of the Skoltech campus. In the library students can discover, analyze, share information, and create new knowledge. There are designated areas either for group collaboration or silent individual study, which makes the library your go-to place for any type of work. The library\u2019s mission is to provide you with access to knowledge. The library\u2019s key services include:\n\n- access to leading journals in various scientific disciplines  \n- access to bibliographic databases, materials tools, a patent database, analytical tools, etc. - access to scientific and business literature (both ebooks and hard copies)  \n- access to PhD and MSc theses of Skoltech graduates  \n- assistance in using digital resources and searching for information\n\nIn short, you can go to the library for research support, assistance with access to digital resources (more on that below) and even some educational events organized by the library team for you. In addition, the library team encourages students\u2019 initiatives and assists in facilitating evens organized by the students themselves. Resources, journals and publications\n\n[The library website](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/library/)  contains updated information related to subscribed resources and access to them. We\u2019ve linked the library website in the description. You have access to numerous high-quality scientific knowledge databases and the latest scientific information. You can find full-text databases, e-books, materials databases, patent databases and more. Now how do you find these digital scientific resources? While on campus and connected to Skoltech WiFi, you can access them seamlessly via the Skoltech Library website. While off-campus, please follow the remote access instructions from the library's website. In most cases, you will be asked to log in using your Skoltech credentials (see the full guide in the description). If you want to check out books, you can use the self-checkout machines (and your Student ID) at the library. However, to gain access the first time you want to check out a book, you will need to introduce yourself to the library team, for them to create your account in their system and show how self-checkout works. Don't forget your campus pass as that is necessary to activate your access to the lock on the door to the library's books. The checkout period is 2 weeks, and you can borrow or return the books from the library 24/7. To reach the library or ask questions, email the team at Library@skoltech.ru .",
