Our first module is called “Meet Skoltech”, and the first topic we’ll touch upon will be “Mission & Vision”. We’ll be talking about the Skolkovo Ecosystem, a Brief History of Skoltech, Skoltech Today, and Strategy & Strategic Goals. 

*Text Overlay: Mission & Vision – Skolkovo Ecosystem, Brief History of Skoltech, Skoltech Today, Strategy & Strategic Goals.* 

Let’s take a closer look at the Skolkovo ecosystem, and the Skolkovo Innovation Center.  
In 2010, then-President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev launched the Skolkovo Foundation You can learn more about the foundation and its goals in the link below. “The Skolkovo Foundation is a non-profit organization whose overarching goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem of entrepreneurship and innovation, engendering a startup culture and encouraging venture capitalism.” To target these areas, the Foundation established several organizations within the education, infrastructure and corporate sectors, which together are called the Skolkovo Innovation Center. You can find the link to this below as well. As you begin your studies at Skoltech, you are not just a student. You are also a full member of the Skolkovo community, which means a lot more opportunities beyond the campus. You’ll learn about them in the next modules. As you’ve probably already guessed Skoltech is one of the major educational entities within the Skolkovo Innovation Center.  
Now let’s see how special our university is and what opportunities it will open up for you. 

*Text Overlay: Skoltech: from the early days to today* 

Let us start by saying that you’ve come to a very unique university. Skoltech is a one-of-a-kind institute in Russia, and one with few similar educational organizations worldwide. Don’t get us wrong \- there are dozens of incredible universities out there, but can you think of one that has been named among the Top 100 in just the first 8 years of its existence? Exactly\! Ah, wait, let’s back up a little. Skoltech was established in 2011 in collaboration with MIT with the vision of being a worldleading institute of science and technology and the mission to impact economy and society development by academic and technology excellence and entrepreneurial spirit. Skoltech became a home for talents who are working in promising areas of global science and technology agenda. The broad, but well-structured portfolio divided among several Centers covers Artificial Intelligence and Communications, Life Sciences and Health, Cutting-edge Engineering and Advanced Materials, Energy Efficiency and ESG, Photonics, and Advanced Studies. Skoltech research excellence is globally recognized: the Institute appeared among top-100 world’s leading young universities in the prestigious Nature Index ranking. To learn more about the faculty, students, alumni, and their achievements, see the link below. You can also find more information about the university’s achievements there as well.   
Today Skoltech brings together some of the most qualified, high-achieving faculty, researchers and students from around the world. So as you join this community, be sure that with their help, you will master and apply unique technological competencies that are shaping the future and humanity literally as we speak right now.

*Text Overlay: Skoltech’s Strategy and Goals*

Skoltech’s mission, as stated in the Skoltech Strategy 2021-2025, is to facilitate the economy and society development by academic and technology excellence and entrepreneurial spirit. Our unofficial motto is: “Targeting excellence today, we impact tomorrow”. In context of these aspirations, you will witness Skoltech becoming: a world leading university producing substantial economic impact in Russia a full-fledged university providing education in BSc, MSc and PhD programs the 1st choice university for the brightest students in Russia. You can find more information about Skoltech’s five-year plan in the links below. 

Let’s now take a look at Governance & Management, which includes: Leadership, Collegial Bodies, Structure: Centers & Departments, Programs Management: Directors, Coordinators & Research Advisors

*Text Overlays: Governance & Management  — Leadership, Collegial Bodies, Structure: Centers & Departments, Programs Management: Directors, Coordinators & Research Advisors*

So, who is behind Skoltech? You will obviously get to know your professors and fellow students in the next few weeks, but you should also probably know who runs the university on the administrative side. You know, just to have an idea. Skoltech was founded by the top Russian companies and leading institutes. Among them are VEB.RF, Sber, MIPT, New Economic School, Moscow School of Management.The Founders are entitled to approve the Charter, establish the Institute's governance bodies, and appoint the Board of Trustees. You can read more about the Founders below. Honored academics, statesmen and businessmen make up the Board of Trustees. Members of the Board set and hold Skoltech accountable for following its strategies, as well as oversee the development of the university. The final key player of the Skoltech government bodies is the Student Council, whose role is to voice student needs to the university administration. Each year, students elect the Council and its President, Vice President and Coordinator to represent you over the course of the next academic year. You will learn more about the Student Council’s role and activities in the next module.Meanwhile, let’s see what happens behind the scenes of the day-to-day management\! Below you will see Skoltech’s current leadership team . It consists of the University President and Provost, as well as several Vice Presidents and Deans responsible for different areas of the university’s management. You will get to know team members and leaders of these departments as you attend Skoltech events throughout your time here.  
 Skoltech’s research and education activities revolve around several target domains: 

* Artificial Intelligence & Telecommunications  
* Cutting-edge Engineering, Advanced Materials  
* Photonics  
* Life Sciences & Health, Agro  
* Energy Efficiency & ESG  
* Advanced Studies

*Text Overlay: **several target domains**:* 

* *Artificial Intelligence & Telecommunications*  
* *Cutting-edge Engineering, Advanced Materials*  
* *Photonics*  
* *Life Sciences & Health, Agro*  
* *Energy Efficiency & ESG*  
* *Advanced Studies*

By the way, management doesn’t cover just academics and research, right? There are entire departments responsible for cooperation with industry, communications and student affairs. 

For instance, you will most likely hear from these people quite often: 

* Education Department — about your academic affairs, curriculum and more  
* Student Department — about student activities, benefits, scholarships and more  
* Accommodation team — if you’re living in the dorms, you will get to know the housing team pretty well:)

*Text Overlay:* 

- *Education Department*   
- *Student Department*  
- *Accommodation team* 

Finally, the people you will interact the most with are members of your Centers and Programs. You will most likely hear from your Program Director and Coordinator, as well as spend a ton of time with your research advisor while working on your research. Now you know you’ll meet a lot of people here. And a lot of people come with a lot of different backgrounds, experiences and stories. That brings us to our next section: Skoltech’s Community and Values.

*Text Overlay: Skoltech’s Community and Values.*

When you applied to Skoltech, you probably heard that our students, faculty and employees come from more than 45 countries around the globe. Skoltech’s community is as rich and diverse as it can possibly be, and that’s what makes this university so unique. Skoltech is highly selective, as you know, so you will be surrounded by the world’s best minds. How exciting is that? The multicultural environment is felt as soon as you enter the hall, so you will notice that one feature that unites us all is the English language. 

*Text Overlay: English language.*

All courses are taught in English, all research is conducted in English and most student activities are held in English. Speaking English with your friends, even if you’re all native Russian speakers, is respectful to your fellow international community members when they are around.

*Text Overlay: Mutual respect, diversity and Code of Ethics*

Speaking of respect, we will say this right from the start: at Skoltech, all your relationships (academic, personal and professional) are based on respect. We do not discriminate against people based on their race, gender, age or any other personal feature or trait. We value you for who you are and do not tolerate inappropriate or disrespectful behavior of any kind. Moreover, we also don’t discriminate against people based on their religion or political views, opinions or life in general. Please make sure that you read the Code of Ethics in detail using the link below. Among other things, it highlights that we have all gathered here for science, innovation, and education. Please leave your conflicts and arguments on other topics outside of the Campus. 

*Text Overlay: Policies*

Now along with the Code of Ethics, you will likely hear the term “Policy”. A Policy is an official document passed by Skoltech’s leadership team to optimize the university’s functions and/or activities. For instance, you can hear something like “Skoltech Policy on Student Scholarships and Other Benefits” or “Skoltech’s IP policy”, which, btw, you will learn about in the next modules.   
The policies don’t just appear out of thin air: their formation is a long process that involves all the leadership and representative parties of Skoltech you’ve read about already. That includes the students, too. In fact, before a policy is drafted, **Skoltech makes sure to give the students the opportunity to voice their concerns or opinions** on the issue in question through the Student Council. You can also participate in working groups and contribute your feedback any time. So this way, you the students are quite literally the policy makers of the institute\!

*Text Overlay: Feedback and freedom for exploration*

Finally, Skoltech is a young university. That means you, as part of the growing community, have an opportunity to shape its values and mission. One way to do that is through feedback, and here we want to stress that **your feedback and participation in university-wide initiatives is crucial** to strengthening Skoltech as an international community of scientists every day. 

As a student, you have incredible freedom to explore your passions, try your hand in different subject areas and even work-related activities. This university was literally built to open your abilities and your mind, to help you reach for incredible goals and achieve them. The growth of our community and university wouldn’t be possible without your input. 

Please keep that in mind as you dive into your academic year and the next lessons of this orientation course. Embrace the opportunities that come your way, and get the most out of them while you are still here. 

Life tends to be quick, but the memories, knowledge and experience that you’ll gain from the next few years at Skoltech will last you a lifetime. 

This is the end of Module 1\. Please read through all the links and documents in the description, and we’ll see you in the next one\!

## “Navigating the Skoltech Campus” \- Module 2

### Text Before Video 3

In this module, let’s talk about the Skoltech campus and how to get around it.

What will you find here?

* Location & Transportation  — public transport and renting vehicles   
* Spaces and Common Areas — navigation ideas and community spaces  
* Research Facilities — cool labs and shared facilities

### Video 3

In this module, we’ll be talking about navigating the campus. 

*Text Overlay: Navigating the Skoltech Campus*

Our first topic is Location & Transportation. This includes the following: Premises Location, Public Transport & Carsharing, Personal Cars & Parking. 

*Text Overlay:  Location & Transportation — Premises Location, Public Transport & Carsharing, Personal Cars & Parking*

By now you’ve probably heard that our campus and its premises are pretty cool. In fact, you may have visited it during an Open Doors event or perhaps a conference or a summer school. The Skoltech Campus is located at   
30с1 Bolshoi boulevard, Skolkovo, Moscow, 121205, Russian Federation   
Here it is in Russian:  
Большой бул., 30, стр 1, Москва, Россия, 121205

*Text Overlay:*  
 ![][image1]  
Here we’ll break down the main ways of getting to Skoltech: public transport, taxis, personal vehicles, carsharing, and renting a bike or scooter.

*Text Overlay:*

- *public transport*  
- *taxi*  
- *personal vehicle*  
- *carsharing*  
- *renting a bike or scooter*

This is important information to have on hand, with many links to external applications and resources, so we have a text version as well, which you can find below this video. Once again, please study this material in detail, otherwise you might have a lot of questions on how to get to campus. 

Moving onto the next topic \- Spaces and Common Areas. Here we’ll be talking about Campus Concept & Navigation, go on a Classrooms & Library Tour, show our Community Spaces, and talk about Food On & Off Campus. 

*Text Overlay: Spaces and Common Areas — Campus Concept & Navigation, Classrooms & Library Tour, Community Spaces, Food On & Off Campus.* 

In a few days, you will arrive at the Skoltech campus. Spoiler alert: it’s a magnificent building with lots of rooms, spaces and auditoriums to visit. Let’s take a quick tour around it so you don’t get lost when you arrive. 

But first, a little history. The Skoltech campus \- the large crown-like wooden building you see on the photos and panoramas \- was completed in 2018 by a world-renowned architectural agency Herzog de Meuron. The building’s concept and execution became such a marker in Moscow’s architectural environment that it won the 2019 Prix Versaille \- a prestigious world architecture and design award under UNESCO. 

The campus consists of administrative, multifunctional, classroom and laboratory spaces. All spaces and facilities are united by large rings.

***Graphic:** We see a view of the campus from above, and draw on it.*

The larger (outside) ring is an administrative space. There you will find the university’s admin personnel like Human Resources, Procurement, Education, and the President’s Office. The smaller internal rings are public and student spaces where you will find classrooms, meeting rooms, student support services and more.

To tell these rings apart, you can just look at the flooring: administrative spaces have carpets, like public and student-focused spaces have wooden floors. 

***Live-action video:** we walk through these spaces with the host**.*** 

You’ll notice the campus has three floors and a huge underground level. To have a closer look, visit virtual tour . 

The first floor is where the laboratories are located. From the outside they look like 12 rectangular facilities with a white facade. Each laboratory has direct street access, cement flooring (for safety reasons) and, for now, limited access. You will also find the main entrance, ATMs, canteen, and cloakroom on the first floor. The second floor is home to most public spaces and multifunctional zones used for large gatherings like conferences and celebrations. There are quite a few meeting rooms you can reserve for your team work, open space office areas for university personnel, the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation work areas and more. The third floor is the students’ kingdom. Here you’ll find most classrooms and auditoriums, the library and other student-oriented spaces. All classrooms are designed to be flexible, mobile and multifunctional. This means that you can easily move your desk or separate a large room with a divider to literally create a new space for a certain class. You can do most of these things yourself or request the facilities team to come and help you out ahead of time. At this point, you’re probably wondering how to NOT get lost in such a huge campus. With a 130,000+ square meter area, it can seem scary at first. But the campus has a pretty smart navigation system which we’re sure you’ll figure out even on your first day.  
In short, a certain room location can look something like E-R3-2020. Don’t panic yet, we’ll explain what each of these letters and numbers mean. 

1) The first letter E indicates that the room is located on the main Skoltech campus. That’s an easy one\! R3 (or R1 or R2) indicate the ring you’re on.   
2) R3 is the ring where you will find the Student Department.   
3) 2020 is the actual room number, located on the second floor. Rooms on the third floor start with the digit 3\. 

By the way, room E-R3-2020 is home to the Student Council team, which you’ll meet in the next modules.  
 ![][image2]

### Sometimes the location can include an additional letter section \- like A, B, or C and look like this: E-C4 or E-A1. The C4 and A1 here means it’s a laboratory facility.

### ![][image3]

### However, some laboratories are being moved, so make sure to ask your professors and scientific advisors for the exact location of your lab before going there. It’s possible some labs are located in a different building on the Skolkovo Innovation Center territory. In case you need a visual, take a look at this brochure that shows how Skoltech navigation works in the description. You can also save this handout with a map to your smartphone and glance at them as you explore the campus. 

### *![][image4]*

### This reminds us of something else: we are always improving the campus and its facilities, so it’s possible some areas will be closed or moved at one point or another. This doesn’t happen often, but make sure to avoid any obvious construction zones, alright?

### Now we should probably talk about the space where you’ll spend most of your time doing homework, collaborating on projects and meeting your colleagues. 

### That space is the learning commons, or, you know, the library\!

*Text Overlay: the library\!*

Contrary to popular belief, the library is no longer a strict, no-talking-allowed place where you will bury yourself in books. By all means, you can do that too, but the Skoltech library is truly special. The librarians, designers and architects at Skoltech have put a lot of thought into creating a space where you can….well, do everything. Sometimes you need a few hours of quiet, at others \- a large networking zone to debate a new concept with your friends. Or perhaps you want to eat? Just kidding, that’s what the cafeteria is for.

The Skoltech library is not only about books for loan, it is an academic hub for learning outside a classroom and doing research outside a lab. It combines digital infrastructure and self-directed learning space. In the library students can discover, analyze, share information, and create new knowledge. There are designated areas either for group collaboration or silent individual study, which makes the library your go-to place for any type of work.

We’ll tell you more about using the library’s website, searching for publications in databases and getting the most out of the library’s resources in the next module.

What are some cool features about the library space, then? For example, you’ll notice some QR codes on the walls. If you scan them, you will find the most quoted research published by Skoltech scientists and students. Yours could end up there, too\! Also, book crossing shelves. They are everywhere :) Bring your own books, exchange old ones anonymously or read on the spot as you desire.

While no food or drinks are allowed on the premises of the library, your thoughts, debates and other activities are allowed any time. Librarians are there for you if you want to organize a group activity, do not hesitate to contact them and suggest your ideas. Like the campus, the library is open 24/7 and has several multifunctional zones that vary based on the level of noise, from silent to loud. 

If you need a quick distraction from your studies, just glance around and solve some quirky riddles, word search puzzles and even quests. That stuff will keep you entertained for a loooong time :)     

Alright, so what else can you find on the campus? Quick answer: a lot\! Let me just list a few spaces and facilities so you know they exist:

* Music room  
* Exercise room   
* Several photo zones  
* A coffee shop, cafeteria and several food machines around the campus  
* Fully equipped kitchens with hot water, basic kitchenware and some ingredients for tea  
* Outside terraces (aka summer lounge zones)   
* Art exhibitions   
* An indoor basketball court  
* A table tennis table  
* A multifaith prayer and meditation room

Speaking of tours, check out [this virtual tour](https://360.skoltech.ru/)  of Skoltech to see the campus with your own eyes. The link is available in the description.

Let’s keep exploring the campus, shall we? We’ve already talked about the classrooms, the library and the cafeteria, but we haven’t yet seen the most technological part: research facilities\!

*Text Overlay: Research Facilities*

One of the most impressive (and open to all students) research space here is the FabLab. FabLab & Machine Shop (links to an external site)is a universal laboratory for students and Skoltech community members where you can create almost anything, anytime\! In fact, it is one of the most unique university facilities, because students can come here with an idea and leave with a prototype within a few hours. How cool is that? At Skoltech, creative research and spontaneous ideas revolve about this laboratory. It has equipment to quickly create prototypes and conduct experiences. There are machine tools, 3D printers and a bunch of other things like:

- Metalworking  
- Woodworking  
- Auxiliary equipment  
- 3D printing  
- Electronics  
- Laser cutting and engraving  
- Working with fabric  
- Casting  
- And more

You can find the complete equipment catalog on the FabLab page, linked below. The complete video tour of the facilities is also available there.

As a Skoltech student, you have 24/7 access to the FabLab Facility and any basic materials, tools and equipment you may need. Some tools can be custom ordered for your project, too.

On a more serious note, all this equipment and machinery requires training. That’s why to gain access to the lab, you’ll need to pass at least one required safety training course and repeat it every 3 months. 

Here are some of the important safety rules at the FabLab and any research facility at Skoltech, really:

* Every new student needs to pass the EHS induction training and safety training provided by a responsible person before lab access.  
* Always wear safety goggles and other required means of personal protection. Always\!   
* No food or drinks  
* Do not work in the FabLab without an employee accompanying you (for safety reasons)   
* Pay attentions to signs on machinery and equipment  
* Do not try to access rooms or areas marked with red lines  
* Be extra careful around yellow lines

 *Text Overlay:*

* *Pay attentions to signs on machinery and equipment*  
* *Do not try to access rooms or areas marked with red lines*  
* *Be extra careful around yellow lines*

Some of the more advanced equipment requires more targeted training \- special (free\!) 1-3 hour courses led by FabLab employees. That equipment is marked with a special sign. If you want to use it, ask the FabLab team about training. Speaking of the FabLab team, they are your most valuable resource\! All of the FabLab employees are trained experts. You can consult with them about your projects, get help with any equipment and, of course, learn from them.  At this point you may be asking, “What about other labs?”

Duh, Skoltech has dozens of labs with fascinating and unique equipment\! To save you some time and intrigue right now, we won’t go into detail about each and every lab here. That’s mostly because your scientific advisors and program coordinators will give you a much more in-depth orientation around the labs related to your center.

If you want to take a look at some of the interesting objects right now, click the Skoltech virtual tour link in the description. 

Let’s talk about some safety and ground rules here at Skoltech. As an educational institution, it should come to you as no surprise that there are some rules to ensure your safety. Some are just good, logical practices \- like no running \- while others are strictly prohibited for everyone’s safety \- like no food or drinks in laboratories.

*Text Overlay: Ground Rules and Safety*

For a start, you should know that the campus is closed to visitors without a pass. That’s basically anyone who is not a student or an employee of Skoltech. Each visitor \- even your mom and girlfriend \- will need a pass to enter the halls beyond the security line. Talk to the Education Office if you need a guest pass for someone as an exception. 

It is prohibited to: 

* ### smoke tobacco products, as well as evaporative mixtures used in devices for 

* ### drink alcoholic beverages (including beer and other low-alcohol drinks);

* ### generating aerosol, steam, or smoke outside designated areas, use open fire, including in areas directly adjacent to buildings;

We also expect you to follow some basic social behavior rules. Avoid any discriminatory or violent actions or words. Be respectful of others’ space and activities, don’t interrupt people when they’re conferencing or studying in silence. And the most important rule: don’t cut in line at the cafeteria \- everyone there is as hungry as you are\! But that one is a pretty obvious one, right?  

In case of emergency, you will hear an alarm throughout the building and you will be asked to walk towards general assembly areas outside of the buildings.

In case of a fire or any kind of alarm-sounding emergency 

1. Walk to the nearest fire exit  
2. Take the stairs (don’t take the elevators)   
3. Check in with an employee in a bright vest  
4. Follow the instructions of security and safety personnel.

**Topic 1  “ Location & Transportation  — Premises Location, Public Transport & Carsharing, Personal Cars & Parking”**

By now you’ve probably heard that our campus and its premises are pretty cool. In fact, you may have visited it during an Open Doors event or perhaps a conference or a summer school. 

![][image7]The campus is located within the Skolkovo Innovation Center territory a few minutes away from the center of Moscow. The campus is part of the Skolkovo Innovation Center, which is a closed territory. This means you may need a car pass if you decide to drive here. 

So, you can reach the campus in multiple ways.

 **First, you can use public transportation.** 

This is the safest and surest way to reach the campus if you need to be there by a certain time (or just want your arrival time to be predictable). No matter where you are traveling from, you can use Moscow’s MCD-1(Moscow Central Diameter \#1) metro line to get to the Skolkovo Train station. It’s about a 20 minute ride from the city center. You’ll need to exit the train at the “MCD Skolkovo” (Сколково) station.

Once you arrive, take the stairs, escalator or an elevator to the second floor and walk down the looooong hall of the Orbion building. Then, once again, go down to the 1st floor and exit. 

Once you exit the building, you can take the Sk1 bus shuttle from the nearest bus stop (look to your left). 

Or, you can take a walk towards the Amaltea business center, walk down the stairs, cross the road and catch any shuttle bus that goes towards Skoltech (the wooden building that looks like a crown, you’ll know it when you see it). This way will take about 10 minutes if you are a fast walker. 

Remember that the shuttle buses at Skolkovo have paid fares (same as within the Moscow public transportation system, we’ll talk about that in the next modules) and can be tracked via [Yandex maps](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\&z=10) 

[(links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\&z=10)

By the way, the Skolkovo Innovation Center website also has some tips on how to reach other buildings on the territory. Visit [https://sk.ru/transport/](https://sk.ru/transport/) 

[(links to an external site)](https://sk.ru/transport/)

for more information.

![][image8]

 

The next best thing is to take a taxi

Currently, only taxi services [Yandex (links to an external site)](https://taxi.yandex.ru/ru\_ru/) , [Citi Mobil](https://city-mobil.ru/) 

[(links to an external site)](https://city-mobil.ru/) , and [Uber  (links to an external site)](https://support-uber.com/) have automatic access to the Skolkovo Innovation Center. 

All you need to do is download a relevant app to your smartphone, order a taxi to Skoltech (just type “Сколтех” in the destination, it will be there) and relax. Don’t forget to buckle up\!

If you take a different taxi service, you’ll need to order a territory pass ahead of time. 

To order a pass for your taxi, email security.campus@skoltech.ru from your Skoltech email address with your taxi’s model and license number (i.e. Toyota, Х111СК197). 

Wait for an email confirmation from the security team before trying to enter the gates. You should get an answer within 10-20 minutes.

 

 Third, you can drive your personal car.

This is surely a comfortable way, but it also involves a few nuances like parking and a security pass. Let’s go in order. 

If you decide to drive your own car, you will first need to order a security pass to enter the Skolkovo Innovation Center Territory. Without this pass, security will not let you through the territory gates no matter how hard you try to convince them. 

To order a car pass, send an email to security.campus@skoltech.ru from your Skoltech email address that ends with @skoltech.ru. In that email, write the following information: 

1. your car’s model and license number (i.e. Toyota, Х111СК197)   
2. How long you need the pass for (1 day or the whole month). 

If you ask for a monthly pass, you’ll need to *renew it every month* via email. 

Next, you’ll need to find a parking spot because you can park only in designated parking lots. 

Wait, let us stress that again: if you park your car anywhere *besides* a parking lot, it will be towed and your access to the Skolkovo Innovation Center territory will be restricted… *forever*\!

A current list of all Skolkovo parking lots is published on [sta-parking.ru (links to an external site).](https://www.sta-parking.ru/) (RUS). 

 ![][image9]

 

In terms of parking prices, parking is free for 2 hours and then 50 RUB per hour. Spaces are pretty limited, though. To secure a spot and entry in the long-term, you can email Clients@sta-parking.ru. Monthly parking plans start at 5000 RUB/month. 

Finally, you can also park outside of the Skolkovo territory. You can try the [Tri Kita Mall parking lot (links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/org/tri\_kita/1112120378/?indoorLevel=1\&ll=37.355723%2C55.702835\&z=17.03) or near the [“Innovatsya” apartments (links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?indoorLevel=1\&ll=37.355723%2C55.702835\&mode=poi\&poi%5Bpoint%5D=37.357476%2C55.700718\&poi%5Buri%5D=ymapsbm1%3A%2F%2Forg%3Foid%3D191529528774\&z=17.03), but spaces there are not guaranteed.   

**Carsharing is another option.** 

A great option for transportation without the upkeep fees, are we right? 

Carsharing services [BelkaCar (links to an external site)](https://belkacar.ru/) and [DeliMobil (links to an external site)](https://delimobil.ru/) have access to the Skolkovo territory with some parking options around the territory.

If you choose to use a different car sharing service, you may need to search for a different parking option outside of the Skolkovo Innovation Center Territory (for example, there is an “external” parking lot just behind the Skoltech campus that’s not part of the Skolkovo infrastructure). In that case, we suggest looking for an “end destination” spot ahead of time. *Phew, we’re almost there:)*

Are you up for a scooter or a bike ride? 

The Skolkovo territory has lots of electric scooter and bike stations where you can rent one from March to November (watch out for puddles\!). For instance, there is a bike/scooter stop right outside of the MCD Skolkovo station so you can start your day with a breeze.

To rent one of these sweet rides, scan a QR code on the vehicle and follow the instructions.

Highlights: 

* There are enough ways to get around Skoltech using the developed transport system. Choose a favourite bus route or just rent a bicycle — the choice is yours\!      
* Circles are all around you — save a campus map on your phone and forget about getting lost.   
* Our research facilities provide numerous opportunities for accomplishing your projects. Don’t forget to register for a training course beforehand.   
* It is important to follow safety and ground rules to stay out of trouble.

⏭️ What’s next?

Our [next module](https://skoltech.instructure.com/courses/3974/assignments/22739) is devoted to the education process, student status requirements and detailed program curriculum.

## “Education Process, part 1” \- Module 3.1

### Text Before Video 4

Hey, you’ve made it to the Education module\! Right on\! 

In this section, you will learn about the essential elements of your MSc studies at Skoltech. 

What you will find here:

* Academic Integrity —  What is academic misconduct and how to avoid it  
* Education Process —  Academic structure, grading system, course registration 

### Video 4 

In this module, we’re going to talk about Academic Integrity. This includes Academic Misconduct and Disciplinary Measures. On top of that, we’ll discuss the Education Process, which covers Academic Structure, the Grading System, and Course Registration.

*Text Overlay:* 

- *Academic Integrity : Academic Misconduct , Disciplinary Measures*  
- *Education Process : Academic structure, grading system, course registration* 


Let’s start with Academic Integrity. It relies on our community’s personal values and policies on ethics, conflict of interest, and others. We expect everyone to: 

- Follow professional courtesy  
- Be committed to honesty without compromising their values  
- Promote the truth without compromise

*Text Overlay:* 

- *Follow professional courtesy*  
- *Be committed to honesty without compromising their values*  
- *Promote the truth without compromise*

This is very important because it leads to the respectful culture that you develop in terms of how you conduct your academic studies, publish in top journals recognized in the most prominent fields, and other achievements. 

If, at any stage or time, the integrity of your studies is compromised, you will enter the realms of academic misconduct.

*Text Overlay: academic misconduct.*

Formal definitions of academic misconduct say that it is the intent of the individual participating in this to cheat the system in some way to gain something in return. ​​What’s considered academic misconduct?

* Deliberate interference with the integrity of others’ work  
* Fabrication or falsification of data  
* Unauthorized collaboration  
* Plagiarism  
* Cheating

*Text Overlay:* 

* *Deliberate interference with the integrity of others’ work*  
* *Fabrication or falsification of data*  
* *Unauthorized collaboration*  
* *Plagiarism*  
* *Cheating*

Research Misconduct includes such offenses as:

* Substitution of data  
* Unrealistic precision of data  
* Results that contradict known physics

*Text Overlay: Research Misconduct includes such offenses as:*

* *Substitution of data*  
* *Unrealistic precision of data*  
* *Results that contradict known physics*

You can learn more about disciplinary actions by clicking the link below. 

Discipline is an important part of any academic organization, and in this case Skoltech is no exception. Students who cheat, plagiarize or participate in any other form of academic or research misconduct (including failing classes and violating full time status) are subject to an evaluation by the Skoltech Disciplinary Board (DB).

*Text Overlays: Disciplinary Measures at Skoltech*

If a faculty member witnesses a student’s academic misconduct, the student’s name will be submitted to the Disciplinary Board. Both the student and the witness will be given a chance to explain their positions in writing. Then the Disciplinary Board will make a decision regarding the student’s status at Skoltech. Each case of academic and research misconduct is taken seriously and reviewed on an individual basis. For more information about this, please see the Disciplinary Board Policy via the link below. 

The DBP Skoltech Disciplinary Board is an internal committee formed in order to address the issues related to student misconduct and the other disputes between students and Skoltech. The Disciplinary Board reviews individual cases related to the following:

- academic misconduct  
- full-time student status violation  
- poor academic performance  
- violation of the attendance regulations  
- violation (by the students) of other policies  
- and regulations governing educational  
- processes  
- other academic-related issues /conflicts

*Text Overlay:*

- *academic misconduct*  
- *full-time student status violation*  
- *poor academic performance*  
- *violation of the attendance regulations*  
- *violation (by the students) of other policies*  
- *and regulations governing educational*

Now this lesson wouldn’t make sense without some actual advice on how to avoid academic and research misconduct. 

1. Always consult with your advisor or Education Department if you are unsure about whether a particular action (e.g., dropping a data point) could be questionable.  
2. Make sure you understand why it is ok to manipulate data in certain ways (especially applies if you are following a protocol or methodology originally created by someone else).  
3. Be vigilant about your collaborations. Beware of people who will not show you raw data or who refuse to explain how they convert raw data into a plot / figure / table.

Now let’s talk about the education process itself. We’ll be talking about the Academic Calendar, ECTS & Degree Requirements, Grading System, Course Registration, Dropping/Adding Courses, and Course Evaluations. 

*Text Overlays: Education Process —  Academic Calendar, ECTS & Degree Requirements, Grading System, Course Registration, Dropping/Adding Courses, Course Evaluations.*

Let’s take a look at the Academic Year Structure. 

*Text Overlay: Academic Year Structure*

Skoltech follows a term structure. We have two terms (first of them is divided to 1A and 1B) in the fall and two terms in the spring. In between there is a very short winter term. 

After terms 3 and 4, MSc students have a summer term with no academic classes, but with something called Industrial Immersion. You will learn more about it in the next sections. 

You will notice that  Term 1 begins *on September 5* with Innovation Workshop. You’ll learn about this special course in the next sections. 

You will find the calendar with this year’s schedule, along with the holiday calendar, in the description below.

Okay, so you know Skoltech has several terms. Let’s see how a typical term is structured. 

* Week 1-6: Teaching and learning activities (theoretical knowledge of the topic area)  
* Week 7: Assessment and Feedback (exams, quizzes, assignments)  
* Week 8: Application period (hands-on group and individual projects)

*Text Overlay: Term Structure:*

* *Week 1-6: Teaching and learning activities*  
* *Week 7: Assessment and Feedback*   
* *Week 8: Application period* 

Your updated term schedule can be found on the Skoltech website. You can find a link to it in the description. 

So, how do you succeed and graduate from Skoltech? To get your degree, you will need to meet several requirements. 

*Text Overlay: MSc Degree Requirements*  
***![][image10]***  
You need 120 credits to graduate. Here’s how you get them: 

* STE: Science, Technology and Engineering (36 ECTS-credits)  
  * Provide a solid foundation of scientific and engineering fundamentals  
  * Core and recommended electives  
* Sector: Industrial Immersion (12 ECTS-credits)  
  * Orients students to how a sector works, provides knowledge and skills to make an impact in an industrial sector  
  * Happens in the summer term between Year 1 and Year 2  
* Enterpreneurship and Innovation: Entrepreneurship and Innovation (12 ECTS-credits)  
  * Orients students in the process of, provide the skills for, and experience with innovation  
  * Includes Innovation Workshop  
* MSc Thesis Project (36 ECTS-credits)  
* Early research, Thesis Project, Defense

* Options: elective coursework and short-term projects (24 ECTS-credits)  
* Follow your dreams and passions, choose courses to diversify your experience  
* Additionally you can take 20 credits as an extracurricular activity.

ECTS credits are based on the workload students need in order to achieve the learning outcomes. 1 ECTS equals 27 astronomical hours (36 academic hours). This information is available in the description. 

*Text Overlay:* 

- *STE: Science, Technology and Engineering*   
- *Sector: Industrial Immersion*  
- *Enterpreneurship and Innovation: Entrepreneurship and Innovation*  
- *MSc Thesis Project*   
- *Early research, Thesis Project, Defense*  
- *Options*

How will your course performance be assessed? The assessment criteria are set separately for all courses and described in detail in the each course syllabus. You can refer to the assessment rules prior to course registration. Your instructors will also walk through it at the very beginning of a course. 

*Text Overlay: Grading System*

Skoltech uses an “A-F” grading system. 

* A-E are technically passing grades (although there is a world of difference between an A and an E), but you will receive a full number of credits if you get one of these grades. Aim to get as close to an A as possible, as it comes with many obvious and not-so-obvious benefits like scholarships :)   
* F is a failing grade, which means you will not have passed the course if you get it. If you ever feel you are having trouble with a course and are likely to receive a poor grade, talk to your instructor as soon as possible.  
* Some projects have a Pass/Fail grading scale, and you will be notified in advance if that applies to your course.   
* The course instructor sets the grading scheme for each class, which is explained in the Course Syllabus. The course instructor also makes the final decision about your grade.

We expect you to perform at a “B” grade or better level. Any performance below this may be reported to the Disciplinary Board for further examination. 

*Text Overlay: A-E, F,*  Pass/Fail

Skoltech’s variety of courses allows you to not only choose the ones that complement your educational track, but also be flexible about registering for them or making changes in your schedule (with some regulations, of course). 

When it comes to course registration, we mostly expect you to register for courses yourself with some exceptions. For instance, the Education Department has already registered you for your first course \- Innovation Workshop :) 

For standard terms (so, not Term 1A), registration will happen about 3 weeks before the start of the term (check the calendar\!). Here’s a quick timeline: 

*Graph:* 

![][image11]

Side note:  Short-term projects follow regular registration schedule

So how do you register for your courses?As we’ve already mentioned, you do not need to register for any courses in Term 1A \- you are already signed up for a compulsory course called Innovation Workshop. 

Instructions on how to register for the other terms will be sent to you individually by the Education Department. Meanwhile, you can explore [the courses offered in 2022-2023](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/course-catalog/) (and in the upcoming terms) [using the link below](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/course-catalog/) and choose which ones you want to register for. You can filter courses based on your program, credit load, and instructors.

After you’ve registered for courses, you will be added to your course “page” on Canvas. Here you will see information about your registered courses, your grades, assignments, group work and more. 

Make sure to bookmark Canvas in your browser and check it for updates from your professors and program coordinators on a daily basis\! 

As a student, you have rights and channels for feedback. As Skoltech constantly works on improving this communication, please be aware of the following:

Your student rights:

* To obtain full information on your courses and educational programs, course syllabi, assessment criteria and feedback on your progress  
* To provide your feedback on the quality of courses

 At the end of each course, you will be asked to submit a formal evaluation of the coursework, the course load and your professor, course instructor and teaching assistant. These evaluations are used to collect your *anonymous* feedback on each of your learning experiences. The feedback is then followed-up to Education Department, course instructors and program coordinators. 

If you need to communicate any concerns or issues informally or outside of the formal evaluation period (or if you are unable to solve an issue directly with your research advisor or faculty, please talk to the [Education Department](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/21) информация для связи также в описании. 

If you are a student of a network or a joint program, you probably have a few questions about the logistics of your studies. 

*Text Overlay: Network and Joint Programs and double degrees*

Your schedule, curriculum and even travel times will depend on the program you are in. Moreover, there will be specific regulations on how to submit your original diploma and receive your scholarship if you are a student of a joint or network program. 

The details of your studies are normally coordinated by the Centers to which your programs belong. Each program has its own *coordinator*, who will be in touch with you regarding the essential information (if they haven’t reached out yet). 

Until then, if you have urgent questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the Education Department via [education@skoltech.ru](mailto:education@skoltech.ru). For more details on the Education Department, as well as for all the relevant links, see the description below.

* MSc Program Structure — Innovation workshop, Industrial immersion and Thesis project  
* Academic Mobility — Academic trips, conferences  
* Student Status —  Policies, academic leave and withdrawal

### Video 5

We’re glad to see you with us for the second part of the Education Process. Let’s start with the MSc Program Curriculum, where we’re going to talk about the Innovation Workshop, Independent Studies Period, Industrial Immersion, and your Thesis. 

*Text Overlay: MSc Program Curriculum — Innovation Workshop, Independent Studies Period, Industrial Immersion, Thesis*

As you now know, your curriculum at Skoltech will comprise compulsory and elective courses in various disciplines. While you will certainly dive deep into your subject area studies throughout your studies, you will also get practical training in applying your knowledge. In this section, we will talk about a few compulsory courses within your Master’s program curriculum that will teach you about entrepreneurship, innovation, industrial application and your required research component.   
Innovation Workshop is our flagship course that was designed by MIT specifically for Skoltech. There is a long history of IW development and even a book written about it. This class doesn’t feel like a class at all, which is one of the reasons why students love it. They’ve described it as useful, exciting and even turbulent\!

*Инфографика: Innovation Workshop*

IW Workshop’s goal is to: 

- inspire and instruct you to do new things you have never done before: both professionally and socially. These things will be mostly related to technological innovation, but some of them will be even more general. Beware: you will be pushed. It will be life-changing and worth it.  
- let you meet hundreds of new people in an exciting, intense setup that will facilitate lifelong friendships and partnerships. After all, education is just another name for professional networking.  
- very quickly introduce you to the entire Skoltech universe from inside and outside. 

*Text Overlay:* 

- *inspire and instruct*  
- *meet hundreds of new people*  
- *learn about Skoltech very quickly*

Throughout Innovation Workshop, you will develop lots of ideas, prototypes and even potential startups. It is like a hackathon that lasts all September and grows way out of the initial technology. 

It is hard to believe, but IW is designed in such a way that you won’t have time for anything else: side job, labwork, personal events etc. Be ready to enjoy intensity.

What will you get at the end of the Innovation Workshop?

Good question\! By the end of the course, you will develop a fully functioning product. In the past, the best projects produced a programmed robot for treating autistic children, developed a sound detection system for unmanned aerial rescue vehicles, assembled an electronic nose for industrial safety use, synthesized durable novel materials for industrial engines, programmed neural networks for e-commerce, and employed a laser detector to enhance road surface maintenance.

IW ground rules. We bet your first impression from IW was that it’s an optional class because it doesn’t have any textbook learning. Well, this course sets the foundation to your entire Skoltech curriculum and is definitely not an optional class. In fact:

- You must be present in class at all times, every day. That means you cannot work a side job or attend a conference and get a parallel degree. Innovation Workshop will keep you busy from 8 AM until at least 8PM every day for the entire month of September   
- You only can miss a class if you have official medical documents as proof of your immobility or a critical family emergency (which you must notify your instructor about ASAP). 

*Text Overlay:* 

- must be present for every class  
- absences must be justified by an official medical document

The next topic we’ll discuss is your Independent Study Period. For more details, see the link below. 

*Text Overlay:  Independent Study Period.*

The Independent Study period is a special period of the Winter term that aims to open your leadership skills and introduce you to areas of knowledge and practical skills beyond your main educational field.

ISP encourages all members of the Skoltech community (students, faculty, staff, visiting faculty/staff/experts, etc.) to create and participate in a wide variety of short non-credit courses and projects aimed at sharing an expertise or interest with others, including ones not necessarily related to their day-to-day Skoltech roles. 

A compulsory course for MSc-1 students, ISP contains unusual, yet practical lessons that will complement your everyday life and studies. You can sign up for courses like:

- EQ & Negotiation Games  
- Introduction to Smart People Management  
- Roadmap to Career Success 2.0  
- Operations & Supply Chain Management  
- Presentation Skills and Academic Communication  
- Science Communication  
- And many more

- EQ & Negotiation Games  
- Introduction to Smart People Management  
- Roadmap to Career Success 2.0  
- Operations & Supply Chain Management  
- Presentation Skills and Academic Communication  
- Science Communication

The coolest part is, even you as a student can teach your own course. If you are an expert in a certain subject area (or have a cool practical hobby), you are welcome to submit your idea for teaching. ISP course information and application guidelines will be shared with you closer to the Winter Term. 

Now let’s move on to Industrial Immersion

*Text Overlay:  Industrial Immersion*

Most academic programs at Skoltech focus on preparing specialists who are ready to meet the needs of industry and interests of business. One of such programs is Industrial Immersion. What is industrial immersion? Industrial immersion is a compulsory educational element aimed at getting a real hands-on work experience in the industrial sector. Basically, this is your mandatory summer internship which grants you 12 credits upon successful completion.

*Text Overlay:  12 кредитов*

So, for 8 weeks in the summer, you will do a short term task of operational research and manufacturing problems provided by the host company. Industrial immersion is a full time, in-person gig that happens at the host company’s office with your total commitment. The enrollment process status begins in Term 3\. You can find more detailed information about Industrial Immersion via the links in the description.   
Also, we must stress the importance of having a good CV. You’ve submitted one for admission to Skoltech, remember? Now, the companies will select students for projects solely based on their CV and self-representation, so it’s important to fine-tune it as best you can.

*Text Overlay:* 

- *resume*  
- *self-representation* 

In your CV, you must show relevant experience, highlight projects you will have worked on by the time of application and make sure your writing is top-notch. So we strongly recommend that you visit the Career Center and take a resume writing course in January to get the most out of your experience.

*Text Overlay: Career Center*

Speaking of experience, Industrial Immersion itself will totally count as work experience for your future career and resume. In fact, many Skoltech students receive job offers and valuable connections for future jobs at Industrial Immersion. So, a pretty cool opportunity, huh?

Now let’s talk about Industrial Immersion’s milestones and overall timeline. 

*Text Overlay: Milestones and Timeline*  
*Use the following graph:*  
![][image14]  
*Your major milestones can be broken up into two-month long periods. First, in January and February, you submit your CV. Make sure to spend some time preparing it in advance: visit the Career Center and take an ISP course to help you write a top-notch resume.*  
*Next, in February and March, you need to submit your self-initiated project for approval, if you’re planning on doing one. This is also when companies work with us to propose their own projects and select students based on their CV.*  
*In April and May, you will be assigned to projects in companies, and go through mandatory interviews as a part of this process.*  
*In June and July, you complete your industrial immersion project. You have eight weeks to do so.*  
*You will spend your July and August preparing your project reports, and submit a poster with your results for assessment by the end.*  
*And finally, in the fall, you will present your poster at our Industry Day and receive academic credit towards your degree.*

That’s a lot of steps to follow, right? Something we should stress here is even though you will be notified at the start of each stage, the responsibility for completing the industrial immersion component for your degree is *fully your responsibility*. You are responsible adults, after all. So, don’t view Industrial Immersion as some basic 12 credits towards your degree. View it as an opportunity to grow and set a foundation to your future career. Get the most out of it\! Всю необходимую информацию, мы также оставим в описании.

The MSc Thesis Project is the essence of your time at Skoltech.

*Text Overlay: MSc Thesis Project*

This is where you will spend the majority of your “extra” time outside of your formal curriculum.  
![][image15]  
The milestones for your MSc Thesis Project are pretty straightforward. First, you need to find a potential research advisor and propose your thesis topic to them by January of your first year. You should then have some development on it done by Terms 3 or 4 of your first year. Then you work on it every term in your second year, with the proposal complete no later than October of your second year. Your status review presentations should be done in the Winter Term of your second year. Then it’s onto the thesis draft and pre-defenses by May of your second year, and a final defense in June of your second year.

Right now, you don’t need to worry about securing your research topic or anything like that. However, we know from experience that one of the keys to success in your MSc Thesis Project is selecting the right advisor.  So, here are a few tips:

- Take classes from different instructors and spend time getting to know them  
- Gather feedback from older MSc and PhD students about their experience  
- Try to participate in the lab work of several different labs  
- Keep an open mind, even if you’ve already decided who who want to work with  
- Pay attention to how you work together, not just chat after class. There’s a difference

Now onto Academic Mobility — Network Programs, Exchange Programs, Short & Long Term Academic Trips, and Conferences. 

*Text Overlay: Academic Mobility — Network Programs, Exchange Programs, Short & Long Term Academic Trips, Conferences.* 

Let’s begin with Academic Mobility Options, Academic Trips, and Conferences.   
Skoltech provides academic mobility opportunities for its best performing students. Academic mobility allows a student’s immersion into a worldwide ecosystem of science, research and innovations and provides a unique opportunity: 

- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  
- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   
- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   
- to open new career prospects.

- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  
- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   
- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   
- to open new career prospects.

Now, you may ask: who can apply for academic mobility or an academic trip? It could be students who show outstanding academic performance, have a Skoltech research advisor and a preliminarily defined MS thesis project.  
There are two academic mobility options:   
First \- Short-term trips to conferences of workshops

*Text Overlay: Short-term trips to conferences of workshops*

This opportunity usually becomes available when first results of research work emerge, i.e. Term 1 – 3 are completed. An applying student should be active and contributing participant of the event, presenting a paper or a poster. If you learn about an event you want to participate in, discuss it with your advisor or reach out your program coordinator and contactEducation Department to get further instructions and support.

Second option \- Long-term academic mobility

*Text Overlay: Long-term academic mobility*

These trips are aimed to allow thesis research at highly ranked institutions and recognized research labs around the world. Skoltech competitively selects students’ proposals and provides supporting grants for the approved academic trips. The selection is primarily based on the students’ motivation and justification provided, showing how a trip contributes to the students’ overall educational experience and path. Skoltech also looks at how a proposed mobility opportunity enables students to complete their degree at Skoltech and achieve their post-graduation career goals. The competition process includes primary screening by Education Department and assessment by the Programs. The call for applications is usually announced after Term 3 and the winning applicants schedule their trips to Term 6 – 7\. 

Moving on to Funding.

*Text Overlay: Funding*

Can be provided from a research advisor’s funds or a CREI budget. Long-Term trips are supported by Education Department. We have prepared information on how to apply for you, along with guidelines for reporting after the academic trip, which you can find in the description below. You can also find out more about your Student Status — Active Status Requirements, Academic Leave, Withdrawal & Reinstatement. Please take the time to study this in detail.

Your research advisor will most likely be a part of the relevant laboratory and CREI. You can explore the different centers’ missions and ongoing projects on the Skoltech website, которые находятся под видео. 

Now onto Library Resources. 

*Text Overlay:  Library Resources.* 

Now what’s one of the most essential elements of conducting research? That’s right, resources\! And one place to find them is at the Skoltech Library.

The Skoltech library is not only about books for loan, it is an academic hub for learning outside a classroom and doing research outside a lab. It combines digital infrastructure and a self-directed learning space located on the third floor of the Skoltech campus. In the library students can discover, analyze, share information, and create new knowledge. There are designated areas either for group collaboration or silent individual study, which makes the library your go-to place for any type of work. The library’s mission is to provide you with access to knowledge. The library’s key services include:

- access to leading journals in various scientific disciplines  
- access to bibliographic databases, materials tools, a patent database, analytical tools, etc.  
- access to scientific and business literature (both ebooks and hard copies)  
- access to PhD and MSc theses of Skoltech graduates  
- assistance in using digital resources and searching for information

In short, you can go to the library for research support, assistance with access to digital resources (more on that below) and even some educational events organized by the library team for you. In addition, the library team encourages students’ initiatives and assists in facilitating evens organized by the students themselves.

Resources, journals and publications

[The library website](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/library/)  contains updated information related to subscribed resources and access to them. We’ve linked the library website in the description. 

You have access to numerous high-quality scientific knowledge databases and the latest scientific information. You can find full-text databases, e-books, materials databases, patent databases and more. Now how do you find these digital scientific resources? While on campus and connected to Skoltech WiFi, you can access them seamlessly via the Skoltech Library website.  While off-campus, please follow the remote access instructions from the library's website. In most cases, you will be asked to log in using your Skoltech credentials (see the full guide in the description).

If you want to check out books, you can use the self-checkout machines (and your Student ID) at the library. However, to gain access the first time you want to check out a book, you will need to introduce yourself to the library team, for them to create your account in their system and show how self-checkout works. Don't forget your campus pass as that is necessary to activate your access to the lock on the door to the library's books. The checkout period is 2 weeks, and you can borrow or return the books from the library 24/7. To reach the library or ask questions, email the team at Library@skoltech.ru .

Intellectual property is a key success factor in tech innovation and global impact. As a student, researcher and perhaps a future faculty member, you will see IP processes everywhere. As you dive into the world of entrepreneurship and innovation, you will need to know the laws around Intellectual Property to protect your own inventions and startups.

*Text Overlay: Intellectual Property Management at Skoltech*

Intellectual property is a key success factor in tech innovation and global impact. As a student, researcher and perhaps a future faculty member, you will see IP processes everywhere. As you dive into the world of entrepreneurship and innovation, you will need to know the laws around Intellectual Property to protect your own inventions and startups.

*Text Overlay: Skoltech’s IP Policy*

Now let’s run through some elements of the Skoltech IP policy. You can dive deeper as you get into inventing and Skoltech will walk you through the details. However, just an overview now:

1. When students and faculty invent something using Skoltech’s resources, Skoltech retains the ownership of results of intellectual activities (RIA’s).

RIA’s include patentable inventions and discoveries, computer programs, databases, industrial designs and tangible results produced, derived, created in the course of research and developed or technical activities organized by Skoltech.

However, there is one exception to that rule: when you write something in scientific publications and student dissertations. Then that copyright belongs to you and anyone who worked with you. 

2. When you invent something at Skoltech, you are obliged to disclose the fact of your invention and the invention itself to Skoltech.

No student has the right to give away, assign, sell, transfer or commercialize the results of intellectual activity stemming from his or her work at Skoltech without written permissionto do so. This is designed not to limit you, but to support you in commercializing and scaling your invention beyond just selling your rights away. 

3\.  Tech protection, IP management and commercialization services, and other support services are provided by the staff of [Skoltech’s Knowledge Transfer Office](https://www.skoltech.ru/ofis-transfera-znaniy/) ссылка под видео. 

If you need a consultation or have questions about the technology transfer process at Skoltech, reach out to the KTO team at kto@skoltech.ru to book an appointment. 

You can find all the resources you need for managing your intellectual property in the description below.

The next topic is no less interesting: Student Life — Student Council, Clubs, Sports, Events. 

*Text Overlay: Student Life — Student Council, Clubs, Sports, Events*

Here’s something you probably understood from previous modules is that student voices are heard and listened to at Skoltech. In fact, the university encourages students to voice their opinions on any issues and play an active role in the development of our university. After all, you are the ones studying here, not the president, the faculty, or the administrators :) To help you voice your position and launch initiatives there is a student-run organization called the Student Council.

*Инфографика: Student Council*

It has the following mission: 

1\. To support: Members of the SC are always here to help students with any problem – both emotionally and practically.

2\. To represent: SC is the main source of communication between students and administration. The Student Council represents the interests of all students through the following activities:

- Open meetings with students, which is an opportunity for you to share problems, for the SC to collect them and convey them further to the Skoltech leadership.  
- Constant dialogue with the Student Department. The Student Council works to solve your issues together with the Student Department.  
- Maintaining regular communication with the Education Office  
- Meetings with the Skoltech President to work out some global problems.

3\. To improve: the Student Council works to fix student life issues through implementation of new projects and initiatives.

4\. To organize student activities: the Student Council organizes events for the Skoltech student community and coordinates activities of student clubs. 

*Text Overlay: To support, To represent, To improve, To organize student activities*

Here are some examples of events:

- Club Fair  
- SC Elections  
- Halloween  
- New Year and Secret Santa  
- Talent Show  
- International Night  
- Student Initiation 

*Skoltech archival footage goes here.* 

In short, the Student Council acts as a reliable messenger to consult and support students in university-related issues(but not like bad grades or relationships problems, you know), refer them to the correct department if needed, and represent students in new policies.

You can read about the Student Council in more detail in the description below. Moving on with Student Life. What’s a university without student life? Skoltech has plenty of that\! In fact, you can think of it in terms of three categories: events, clubs and sports. Let’s go in order.  You’ll get to see A LOT of events. Student-initiated events, concerts, meetups, conferences, seminars, holiday celebrations, traditional “student-only” events and others. We encourage you to attend as many events as possible (especially the ones with free food, duh) and keep an eye on your email for announcements/registration details, if any.

Stay tuned, the Student Council will announce the registration and the dates for this year’s Club Fair in September-October 2022\.  At the Club Fair you can look for existing clubs or present your own new one, though that will take some prep work beforehand. Skoltech will support your club and even provide financinacing (if needed) with proper reasons:) How to start your own club at Skoltech

2. Send your application to the Student Council by the deadline for that year.  
3. Present your club at the Club Fair, find your first members  
4. After the Club Fair the Student Council will collect and assess the requests from all Clubs regarding necessary equipment for their activities.

A few rules for running clubs: 

* A club needs to have a club leader and up to 2 deputy leaders (deputies are optional). They are elected for 1 year.   
* The club members must meet regularly \- at least once a month.  
* You will need to provide monthly reports about your club’s activities (events, outings, meetings) to the Student Council Club coordinator. 

 Goooo Skoltech\! Amid all the studying and research, it’s important to keep up your physical activity. And we know some of you are excellent sports people. Skoltech has several competitive sports teams you can try out for:Volleyball, Football, Basketball.

The Skoltech Communications, Marketing and PR team works with students and employees alike to highlight their achievements, findings and inventions in the news (both external and internal) and social media channels. That means you have a chance to get some PR and spread the word about your work, establish yourself as a thought leader in your subject area.

*Text Overlay:  PR & Social Media*

 **Career Opportunities**

You already know so much about Skoltech, studying here and doing research. Now the question is, what’s next? What happens after graduation? 

Well, here are a few stats. 

* 80% of 2021 MSc graduates by September 1st are employed in High Tech companies or continue their PhD studies in Russia and other countries  
* 93 Startups are founded by Skoltech community members — researchers, students and alumni. Alumni Workshop will teach you all about that.  
* Skoltech alumni who continue to PhD study at more than 140 universities around the world.   
* And these are just some of the cool companies our alumni work at after graduation. 

![][image17]

Impressive, huh? The best part is, Skoltech offers you all of the opportunities to achieve the same (or even better) results. 

To help you get oriented in your career opportunities, let’s learn about the **Student Career Center.** 

The key responsibility of the Student Career Center is **providing a clear view of the next step to your amazing jobs**. By the way, that doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll force you to find a traditional job. If you want to launch a startup or conduct research in a lab, that counts too. 

Back to the Career Center. This part of the Student Department offers services and resources that will help you launch your career, including:

- Resources and information about career trends, opportunities, industry partners, graduates stories, etc.  
- Career events with companies’ experts, graduates, academic and Enterpreneurship and Innovation leaders.  
- Solving real tasks during Industrial Immersion, hackathons and events with partners.  
- Support in growing your professional network: meetings with experts in different sectors.  
- Individual career consulting.  
- Support after graduation — onboarding, salary negotiations, etc.

Generally, Skoltech students pursue one of three possible career tracks: Industry, Science and Startup. The Career Center will help you shape your own roadmap for achieving your career aspiration in either track. Here are a few examples.  
If you’re interested in getting **a job in the industry**, you go to the Career Center about:

- Preparing your CV (with Career Center support)  
- Attending Career Events  
- Preparing and getting the most out of Industrial Immersion

For those interested in the **Science track**, you can:

- Discuss future plans with your scientific supervisor   
- Prepare academic CV and motivation letter  
- Talk with Skoltech community (faculty and graduates), look for academic opportunities  
- Student Career Center will help you with CV and cover letter preparation and share Skoltech graduates contacts

A quick side note here: applying for a PhD at Skoltech or any other university is a similar process as applying for a job. The Career Center will help you prepare your documents any time, however, the best resource to find (and get matched to) PhD opportunities will be your scientific adviser. 

If you feel entrepreneurial, the Career Center will have some advice for following the **Startup track**, too:

- Deep dive during Innovation Workshop. Talk with mentors and the Skoltech community (faculty, experts, etc.)  
- Join Skoltech Startup Club   
- Stay tuned, visit special events like Skolkovo Startup Village and join project like Startup Triple Point

By the way, you don’t have to know what track you want to pursue at this moment \- that’s what your studies are for\! Explore as many entrepreneurial opportunities as you can, dive deep into your courses and enjoy your time in the labs. Who knows, maybe you’ll be inspired to do something completely unexpected in your second year? You won’t know unless you try :)

Speaking of trying… The Career Center has a few contests and challenges prepared for you as well\! Every few weeks, you will be invited to participate in **Skoltech Hackathons** — intensive competitions where you are challenged to solve a problem or even create a prototype in just a few hours. These competitions help students:

- Develop hard and soft skills  
- Meet experts from different companies  
- Land internships and jobs  
- Test your skills   
- And have fun, obviously :)

Keep an eye on your email for announcements and hackathon details.

Before we wrap up, you should know about one of the best resources you’ll have as a Skoltech student: its alumni community. 

The Alumni network at Skoltech comprises 1500+ people from 40+ countries. You will have lots of opportunities to make connections, get advice and perhaps even ask for referrals when you look for your job. The Career Center will gladly match you up with an alumni from your field or from a company you want to get an interview at (that’s 100+ companies, honestly). Don’t hesitate to reach out to the Career Center for this resource as well. 

On a final note, there is something you should know before you begin your studies at Skoltech: the Career Center will help you along the way as much as possible, but only you can make a life-changing decision. **Looking for a job or even just planning your career is a job within itself**, so it will take a certain time and effort to find what you are looking for.

### Video 8

As you’ve already learned, Skoltech is a large organization with lots of resources and opportunities. It’s very likely you’ll have questions and requests throughout your studies here, and you’ll be looking for ways to address them. Helpdesk.skoltech.ru is a one-stop shop for all your questions and requests for student services at Skoltech. You can access Helpdesk using your Skoltech credentials: your email and password.  
For questions about educational processes, classes and documents, go to the Education Support section. For questions about student services, accommodation, travels, military documentation (for male Russian citizens only) and other issues, go to the Student Support section.

*Text Overlay: Education Support,* Student Support 

We put together all the information you need, along with useful resources in the short article below the video. 

Let’s start with Student cards and where to find them — Student ID, Bank Card, Social & Other Cards (Insert photos of the passes and cards). 

*Text Overlay: Student cards and where to find them — Student ID, Bank Card, Social & Other Cards* 

Spoiler alert: you need a student ID\! And a few more things:) You will notice that the Skoltech Admissions and Education Offices have requested some information from you: like your recent photo and a confirmation of the spelling of your name.  This information will be used to print your student and building passes (so if you haven’t submitted your photo yet, there is still a chance to pick a good one\!).  Let’s talk about each card you will receive. 

The student ID establishes you as a current student of Skoltech. It is a document with your basic information, and it is issued to all students in their first week of courses. It is generally accepted as proof of student status in different organizations across Russia.

*Text Overlay: Student ID and Building pass*

The building pass is a separate card that gives you access to the main campus, the building on Nobel Street, as well as some closed facilities like the FabLab (we’ll talk about that in the Campus module). You will get your building pass on September 1 \- Orientation Day

You can also get your hands on one of the Social cards (issued by the city of Moscow). 

*Text Overlay:  Social cards* 

A social card is a state-issued document that identifies you as a current student and gives you multiple social benefits from September to June 15th (for electrical trains) every year while you are an active university student. With a social card you can get:

- Discounted transportation tickets for trains, buses, etc.   
- Discounted tickets to cultural events (like theaters, museums and some shows)

![][image19]

Also, you may know that university students get a lot of cool benefits and discounts. Keep up with our weekly digest\!   
   
Scholarship bank cards  
Your monthly scholarship will be delivered to a Skoltech-issued debit card. Well, actually, it will be issued by an authorized bank in the first weeks of September.   
Due to the specific nature of this procedure, all details about signing up for your scholarship card, picking it up and more will be sent to your Skoltech email by the Finance Office. Keep an eye on your email and follow all instructions closely\!

It’s highly likely that in the next few years of your studies you’ll need access to various documents — like proof of enrollment, your original BSc diploma or a letter for military service deferment (don’t panic, that’s only for male citizens of Russia). You can find a list of all the documents you need below. 

Onto IT. Yay, technology\!  You’ll surely need a lot of it during your studies. Let’s dive into what’s available for Skoltech students and the most common resources you’ll use. Important: you will need to bring your own laptop and any accessories for your studies. Skoltech does not provide computer or tech equipment for checkout.  And one more important thing: all activity within the Skoltech net and through Skoltech’s VPN is monitored closely by the IT team. Any illegal activity will have negative consequences on your access to Skoltech’s education and student status. Simply put: don’t do any illegal stuff on the Internet\!  

*Text Overlay: don’t do any illegal stuff on the Internet\!*

You can find more details on IT-related options in the description below. 

Let us start by stating the obvious: every email you receive from Skoltech is important. Each announcement is designed to help you get the most out of your time at Skoltech and fully experience everything this university has to offer.

*Text Overlay:  You’ve got mail — Lines of communication*

That’s why it’s important to monitor your Skoltech inbox and read the announcements you receive. You don’t want to miss any changes to your scholarship or student status, do you? Here’s a list of regular communication to make sure you don’t miss anything:

- TGIF — the ultimate, go-to complication of information, news, leadership opportunities and daily campus information. This is the email to read if you don’t check your email regularly (though now you should\!)  
- Career Digests — advice on job searching, career opportunities, events and fresh job openings (for MSc-2 students and higher)

*These messages need to be animated*

Oh and by the way, not all communication on campus is digital\! You’ll notice some classy white information boards on the walls where you can write inspiring (and very kind) messages, post announcements about your events and more.

Picking up your original diploma from previous university

At the admission stage of your application, you brought your original diploma from your previous university. Right now it is kept safely in the Student Support archive (room E-R3-2030). 

Keeping your original diploma from your previous university is a requirement for receiving Skoltech benefits like your scholarship. However, we understand you may need it for…well, whatever you need it for :) 

You can pick up your original diploma from the Student Support Center by taking the following steps:

1. Email studept@skoltech.ru from your Skoltech email address and ask to pick up your original diploma. Wait for an answer. If you wish for someone else to pick up your diploma, include their full name in your email and ask them to have Skoltech or government ID on them.   
2. Come to room E-R3-2030 from 10 am to 5 pm on working days. Bring your Student ID or any government-issued ID.   
3. Return it within 10 working days. 

Please note, if you do not return your original diploma from your previous university back to the Student Support Center within 10 days, your scholarship will be suspended until you do. 

Original diplomas are not mailed via the post office or sent via courier services. They must be picked up personally or by a trusted party. 

Military Certificates

If you are a male citizen of Russia and a university student, you are eligible for a reference for military deferment (if this doesn’t apply to you, feel free to skip this section).

Please mind that you must personally submit a reference to the military induction center twice a year before October 1 and April 1\. 

You will receive an email with details and instructions on military deferment letters in the beginning of the academic year. Please pay attention to your inbox. 

If you need a reference/letter for deferment at any other point in time, you can send a request to the Student Support Center [via Helpdesk](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/28/create/286).

Let’s see what kind of IT-related options you will have:

* In late August/early September, you received an email about setting up your Skoltech user account, which included your university email (it will end with @skoltech.ru) and account information for internal systems. We hate to state the obvious, but if you’ve made it to Canvas with these credentials and instructions \- congratulations, it worked\!   
* When you arrive on campus, you can connect your devices to the Skoltech Wi-Fi. There will be a few lines to choose from, including a 5G one. Use your Skoltech credentials to connect.   
* If you need to access a resource available only through Skoltech’s local net, you can [request access to the Skoltech VPN](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/create/70).   
* For general IT-related questions and requests, select an appropriate category on [IT Helpdesk](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/4) and submit your question.   
* Also while you are on campus, check out [these instructions](https://wiki.skoltech.ru/display/ITC/Wiki+for+Customers) on the Skoltech Wiki site about things like getting a VPN, changing your password and more.     
* As for available student software licenses…well, there’s a lot\! You can request a full list of available software for students from the Education Office (contact them at education@skoltech.ru) or go ahead and fill a request [via HelpDesk](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/create/115?q=software\&q\_time=1654691133740).   
* If you need to print something on campus, use [this guideline](https://wiki.skoltech.ru/display/ITC/FollowMe+System) to connect to the printers (access them from the campus or via Skoltech VPN).

**We never go out of style \- Skoltech Brand Guidelines** 

The consistency in use of Skoltech’s logos, layouts and other elements in your materials and presentations is not just a matter of compliance with the Institute's policies, it's much more — this is about creating a strong, clear, vibrant and highly recognizable brand of Skoltech. 

Remember: there is no flexibility on using branded elements on Skoltech. If you choose to use a logo or any Skoltech-related element in your materials, they must be compliant with Skoltech’s official Brand guidelines. 

All the current rules, logos, useful templates, color palettes, fonts and other useful materials are presented in a user-friendly format below.

![][image24]

Merchandise

Woooh, Skoltech poooower\! You’ve probably seen some bright and cool Skoltech merchandise on employees around the campus, right? Well, we hate the wait, but the Skoltech Shop is currently in development, and the only way to get Skoltech merchandise now is through public service. 

Unfortunately, hoodies don’t grow on trees and to get your set of free T-shirts, hoodies and other merch you’ll need to volunteer at a Skoltech event or represent Skoltech at a conference (or another event). There’s also merchandise like notepads, pens, cups and more. 

Highlights: 

1. HelpDesk and Skoltech guidelines are your primary sources of getting help: from requesting a certificate or access to gym to dormitory booking.  
2. Save emergency numbers on your phone or just flip your student pass when necessary. Skoltech cares about you, don’t hesitate to use your medical insurance or request mental health support.  
3. The system of IT solutions may seem challenging at first, but once you get to know our services, it works like a charm\!   
4. Social networks and our digests will help you keep track of life on Campus. We also send regular updates on current regulations, so don’t miss out.  
5. We value creativity as much as a stylish and clear message, so don’t forget to use our templates and brandbook materials while telling the world something new about Skoltech.

In this module, we wanted to cover all the details and important nuances you will need to take care of as an international student. Don’t worry, our staff and faculty (and even other students) will be there for you every step of the way. You will be able to ask questions and get support any time you need it. By now, you must be working hard at getting your visa to Russia. You should have received all the instructions and an invitation letter from the Skoltech Admissions Office and, at this point, should know your approximate arrival date in Moscow. Let’s do a quick recap of what you need for a seamless arrival: 

* Invitation letter to Skoltech (from the Admissions Office)  
* Visa to Russia  
* Flight tickets  
* Accommodation booking (either at the Skoltech dormitories, a hotel or an apartment rental)     
* Your travel route and plan for your first days in Moscow

*Text Overlay:* 

- *Invitation letter to Skoltech (from the Admissions Office)*  
- *Visa to Russia*  
- *Flight tickets*  
- *Accommodation booking (either at the Skoltech dormitories, a hotel or an apartment rental)*     
- *Your travel route and plan for your first days in Moscow*

Remember that the academic year will start on September 1st this year, and you must be in town for your first day of studies. Note: foreign students are entitled to apply for an air ticket from a city where they live to the airport of Moscow. This support measure can only be provided once at the year of admission (MSc-1 and PhD-1 only). You can apply for a ticket using HelpDesk. We put links to the help desk in the description of this video. 

Spoiler alert: you’ll be moving to a new country in just a few days. Are you ready? Relocation is a big step for any student (or person, really), but we will support you along the way. A few tips as you pack your bags:

- Plan your route from the airport to your accommodation in advance. Some travel options are listed below.  
- Learn a few Russian words before your trip. There’s a link to a site with Russian words that should get you started. While it’s likely that most people on your way to Skoltech will try to understand and help you, they always appreciate a smart and respectful traveler :)  
- Study the culture and history of Russia at least on a basic level. Some information is available below.   
- If you take any special prescription medicine, check that it will be available in Russia. Bring enough with you as well.    
- Prepare to enjoy your time\! A positive mindset will set you up for success before you even arrive.  

Upon your arrival in Moscow, you’ll probably want to go to your accommodation and relax. No matter what accommodation type you will have booked (we’ll talk about it in the next section), here are some general tips on how to navigate the city of Moscow on your first day. To start, in the description, you can find links to files you may need to access quickly 

Moving on to Currency, bank cards and cash. 

*Text Overlay: Currency, bank cards and cash*

As of 2022, foreign-issued bank cards are not accepted in Moscow, so you will not be able to pay with a bank card at the cash register. As you arrive at the airport and pass security, head straight for the currency exchange shop. Don’t exchange all your money, as the exchange rates at the airport are notoriously bad, but do exchange enough for your first day in the city (aka to travel to your accommodation, treat yourself to a meal and buy a cell phone SIM card). You will likely need between 2 500 \- 3 000 RUB. Afterwards, you can find an official bank with a better exchange rate and exchange your currency there.

Your trip will most likely start from a big transport hub, like the airport / railway station. There should be free WI-FI in case your home service provider doesn't allow you to connect to a cell network in Moscow. We recommend visiting an official shop of any Russian mobile network (MTS (links to an external site), Megafon (links to an external site), Beeline (links to an external site), Tele2 (links to an external site)) and purchasing a SIM-card. You will need to show your passport. The probability that staff of such shops in airports or in railway stations speak English is higher than anywhere else.

*A graphic with app icons and telecom operators goes here.* 

In order to use the internet on your first day in Moscow you can use public Wi-Fi. Most streets in the city center, parks and almost all public transport provide free internet access. Wi-Fi networks are available at over 1,000 locations. Each of them will be marked accordingly to keep you informed. To connect, select "Moscow\_Wi-Fi\_Free" among accessible networks, open the browser and register. This can be done through text messages; you should enter your Russian phone number, and receive a text message with a code. We also advise you to bring a powerbank with you (most airlines and railway carriers allow you to carry a 20 000 mAh power bank).

To make it easy for you to navigate Moscow, we have compiled a list of navigation apps for you. Download them beforeyour trip\! To navigate the metro you will need the Yandex Metro (links to an external site)app, for navigation in public transport you will need a Yandex Maps app (links to an external site)and taxi apps like Yandex Taxi (links to an external site). Feel free to download and save this picture of the Moscow Metro map (links to an external site) as well. You can find the links to these applications and sites, as well as information on how to get to your accommodation from the airport below this video. 

*Graphic with all the apps.* 

*Text Overlay: How to get to your accommodation from the airport*

Now onto accommodation. 

*Text Overlay: Accommodation*

Do you know where you’re going to live yet? Don’t worry, we’ll help you get oriented and show you different accommodation options (and how to book them). Let’s get started, shall we? First of all, all information regarding accommodation can be found on accommodation.skoltech.ru . But we’ll give you an overview here too, just in case. As always, all the links can be found in the description. 

*Text Overlay: accommodation.skoltech.ru*

There are two types of accommodation available for Skoltech students:

1) All students can rent an apartment in or around Moscow  
2) Active students can live in the Dormitories on the Skolkovo territory (priority given to international students

*Text Overlay: 1 \- renting an apartment, 2 \- dormitories*

Both options have their benefits and downsides. Consider these features before making a final decision:

![][image25]

Your first option is finding an apartment to rent. This way, you get to set your own personal rules (as long as your landlord agrees, of course. You can live alone or with friends, that’s up to you. The schedule of the dorms doesn’t affect you, your apartment is your own private space, and only you get to decide whom to invite to visit, and when they have to leave, if at all. You can find options in locations convenient to you as well. On the other hand, you will need to go through the migration registration procedure with your landlord.

Your other option is to live in the Skoltech Dormitory. Here, you will be surrounded by your fellow students, who will always find the time to help solve major issues, or even simply share a meal and dispel boredom with conversation. The dorms are located near the campus, meaning you’re always within walking distance of your classes. Your migration registration also becomes a non-issue, since the dormitory will handle that for you. However, keep in mind that the dorms have their own rules, which were created for the comfort of everyone who lives there.

Now let’s take a closer look at the Skoltech dorms. 

*Text Overlay: Skoltech Dormitories*

The dormitory apartment complex is called Palisad, so you will probably hear that name a lot. Palisad is located near the Technopark, which is within a 20 minute walk or a quick 5 minute bus ride. You choose what you like\! Palisad is part of the Skolkovo Innovation Center, which means students get access to the same facilities as all Skolkovo residents:

* Good transport infrastructure, including bicycles and easy transportation on the Skolkovo territory.  
* Food & shopping locations, including grocery stores, cafés, restaurants and many other things. There are some malls for shopping and entertainment within a comfortable driving distance.  
* Skolkovo sports & recreation facilities and parks  
* Separate garbage collection and utilization

The Palisad Dormitory has 5 types of apartments, which are categorized based on the students' level of studies and status (Master's, PhD, families, etc.). Palisad does not have an opportunity for single accommodation.

Students with disabilities are accommodated in specially equipped apartments accompanying a medical assistant or a family member, if approved by the dorm manager/curator.

*Text Overlay: Students with disabilities*

Master's students are allocated in 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments in groups of 3-6 people. You will get up to 5 roommates. Allocation conditions for MSc students under the HRH Princess of Thailand program are established in separate regulations.

*Text Overlay: Master's students*

PhD students are allocated in studios, 1 and 2-bedroom apartments in groups of 2-3 people. You will get up to 2 roommates.

*Text Overlay: PhD students* 

Married couples and Families are being accommodated in studios with a maximum capacity of 2\. Children of up to 18 y.o. could be accommodated free of charge together with their parents in case of confirmed family accommodation. Additional beds for children are not provided and are subject to your own responsibility. Studios for families with children and for married couples are similar in space and configuration.

*Text Overlay: Married couples and Families*

Other Students (visiting, prospective students) who require short-term accommodation (less than an academic year) are allocated in 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments in groups of 4-6 people. You will get up to 3 roommates. Accommodation for prospective students is free when the student stays for a maximum of 3 nights. 

*Text Overlay: Other Students*

Onto the Dormitory fees. 

*Text Overlay: Dormitory fees.* 

Accommodation rates are established once per year and published on the Accommodation Website, the link to which you can find in the description. You can also find the information on reserving a space in standard rooms there. Remember, students that meet the appropriate requirements can get a discount of up to 55% off for master’s students and up to 45% for PhD students. 

*Text Overlay: Master’s \- 55%, PhD \- 45%* 

So what’s included in this? 

Apartments are fully equipped for living, including bed linen and kitchen utensils. Cleaning is provided 2 times per month; however, students are fully responsible for keeping the apartment and facilities fully clean and in working order. In addition, there is Wi-Fi in each apartment. Religious attributes, personal electronic devices \[including hairdryer\] and household items and chemicals are to be purchased by students depending on individual needs. 

If student dorms aren’t your thing, you can always rent an apartment independently.

*Text Overlay: Apartment rental*

You will have full freedom of movement, set your own schedule, choose your preferred location, number of rooms and so on. But, this also means that you will need to cover the rental costs yourself, connect with your landlord, sign the lease agreements, and take care of your government migration documentation independently. You will search for an apartment independently, however, we are here to provide informational assistance for you to help you find the most convenient and comfortable place to stay. According to Russia's Federal Law of Migration, each international student/tourist/visitor should be registered. It is a lengthy bureaucratic process required for all visitors.

You can look for an apartment flat in different districts near Skolkovo: Tryokhgorka, Odintsovo, Nemchinovka, Novoivanovskoe.

*Text Overlay: Suggested locations: Tryokhgorka, Odintsovo, Nemchinovka, Novoivanovskoe.*

The closest metro stations like Yugo-Zapadnaya, Park Pobedy & Slavyansky Boulevard have bus stops with direct routes to Skolkovo and should get you to the campus within 45 minutes.

*Text Overlay: Yugo-Zapadnaya, Park Pobedy & Slavyansky Boulevard* 

We suggest you choose an area near D1 stations of MCD (Moscow Central Diameters).

### Text After Video 9

You can apply for a ticket using [HelpDesk (links to an external site)](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/28/create/507)

Learn a few Russian words before your trip. [This website  (links to an external site)](https://www.tripsavvy.com/basic-russian-vocabulary-for-travelers-4165285) will be a good start. While it’s likely that most people on your way to Skoltech will try to understand and help you, they always appreciate a smart and respectful traveler :)

Feel free to save this information in your smartphone for easy access in [pdf](https://box.skoltech.ru/index.php/s/GAjwDXjONG9YMa2)   
[Links to an external site](https://box.skoltech.ru/index.php/s/GAjwDXjONG9YMa2) or [jpeg (links to an external site)](https://box.skoltech.ru/index.php/s/GAjwDXjONG9YMa2)

We recommend visiting an official shop of any Russian mobile network ([MTS](https://moskva.mts.ru/personal/mobilnaya-svyaz/tarifi/vse-tarifi) , [Megafon](https://moscow.megafon.ru/tariffs/all/), [Beeline](https://moskva.beeline.ru/customers/pomosh/new-client/tarify/) , [Tele2](https://msk.tele2.ru/tariffs)) and purchasing a SIM-card

Navigation resources (apps, maps and cards)

To make it easy for you to navigate Moscow, we have compiled a list of navigation apps for you. Download them *before* your trip\! To navigate the metro you will need the [Yandex Metro](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/metro) app, for navigation in public transport you will need a [Yandex Maps app](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/maps) 

and taxi apps like [Yandex Taxi](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/taxi). Feel free to download and save [this picture of the Moscow Metro map](https://mosmetro.ru/metro-map/?utm\_referrer=https%3a%2f%2fmosmetro.ru%2fdownload%2fs.jpg%3futm\_referrer%3dhttps%253a%252f%252fwww.google.com%252f) as well. Lastly, we also recommend to purchase [transportation card Troika](https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/31475073/)  (in Russian: Тройка). This card allows you to pay less for each journey on public transport. You can buy a card in any metro station (central metro stations have English speaking staff or you can do this in a ticket vending machine). 

How to get to your accommodation from the airport

If you need to get to the Skoltech dormitories, the exact address is Moscow, Skolkovo Innovation Center, Kulibina st., 2/2 (in Russian: Москва, Инновационный центр Сколково, улица Кулибина 2/2)

* By taxi: If you don't want to worry about taking public transport on your first day, you can always order a taxi directly from the airport or the railway station directly to the Skoltech dormitories or your planned accommodation. We recommend using the [Uber App](https://support-uber.com/) or [Yandex Taxi](https://taxi.yandex.ru/ru\_ru/) (which have open access to the Skolkovo territory). You’ll see the price in advance, would be able to choose the type of the vehicle (considering your bags) and can pay by credit card if you don't have cash on you yet.

* By public transport: It’s likely your flight will land in one of Moscow’s key airports: Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo or Domodedovo. All three airports have an [Aeroexpress train](https://aeroexpress.ru/en/aero/schedule.html) that connects the airports to major metro stations. The Aeroexpress leaves approximately every 30 minutes and requires a separate ticket, which you can purchase in front of the entrance to the train platform. 

→ As you arrive at the final stop of the Aeroexpress train (which will be in the center of the city), walk over to the closest metro station (marked with a big red M), look at the metro map and travel to the metro station closest to your accommodation. You can use the[Yandex Metro](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/metro)  app to plan your route.

→ If you’re traveling to the Skoltech Dormitories, you’ll need to go to the Slavyansky Bulvar metro station which will be located on the dark blue metro line. 

→ Then, at Slavyansky Bulvar, you’ll need to make a connection to the MCD station with the same name and go in the direction of Odintsovo. 

→ The stop you’ll need is called Skolkovo \- does that sound familiar? :) 

→ From there, take an SK1 shuttle and exit at the Technopark stop. The Skoltech dorms will be on your right\! [Here](https://old.sk.ru/city/transport/p/inner.aspx) you will find the exact map of bus routes around Skolkovo. 

   
First of all, all information regarding accommodation can be found on [accommodation.skoltech.ru (links to an external site)](https://accommodation.skoltech.ru/)

**Dormitory fees**

Accommodation rates are established once per year and published on the [Accommodation Website](http://accommodation.skoltech.ru/)  The general price per bed for the 2022-2023 academic year is 25850 RUB per bed per month, but eligible Skoltech students get some nice discounts (55% off for MSc students and 45% off for PhD students). 

Please keep in mind that details like pricing and deadlines are subject to change, so it’s best to double check your reservation details with the dormitory manager once you get to that stage. 

**How to request a spot in the dormitories**

If you are ready to request a spot in the dorms, visit [accommodation.skoltech.ru/booking](https://accommodation.skoltech.ru/booking) or our [HelpDesk](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/28/create/485) . It’s highly recommended to leave your request only *after* you’ve received special communication from the Admissions Office. 

While making your request, select the entire academic year as the duration of your stay (unless you know exactly you are leaving for mobility or any other trip earlier). Otherwise, we cannot guarantee an extension after the date you’ve indicated as your departure date. Later our Dormitory Head Irina Morozova will contact you and tell you about further steps. [Here](http://box.skoltech.ru/index.php/s/OCyRCqveR7dFwsn) you can find specific regulations for student accommodation. 

**How to find an apartment**

All current suggestions are listed on [accommodation.skoltech.ru](https://accommodation.skoltech.ru/) Here the ones valid for 2022:

![][image26]

**Safety tips for your search**

Renting a flat can be tricky, so here are a few tips before you get started:

* **Always put your safety first.** If you don’t feel comfortable with a landlord or something feels off, follow your instincts and leave.  
* Remember, **not every landlord will be able to speak English**. This might be a reason for them to decline your rental request.  
* Make sure that your **landlord makes a registration slip** for you (more on that in the Migration section).  
* **Read the lease agreement** before signing it. You can ask Skoltech to check out your lease agreement or offer the landlord to use [this template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zTocaxg1RAd88ym3WJXwYYtf4gOB4A0Q/view?usp=sharing). Be careful and **do not pay any deposits before signing the lease agreement** or before you see the landlord and the apartment itself. Do not click on suspicious links. To learn more information on how to protect yourself, [read this article](https://www.cian.ru/stati-chto-proverit-pered-tem-kak-snjat-kvartiru-218384/), as well as some recommendations [here](https://www.cian.ru/stati-instruktsija-kak-raspoznat-fejkovoe-objavlenie-325224/?utm\_source=massovie\&utm\_medium=push\&utm\_campaign=push\_b2c\_raspoznat\_fejkovoe\_objavlenie\_24\_05\_22) . Or, you can [check out the blacklist of landlords in Moscow](http://mosfo.ru/nedvizhimost-moskvy/chyornyj-spisok-arendodatelej-moskvy)  (yes, it exists). 

**Migration Rules** 

Migration sounds serious, but in reality, this term is used for anyone who is moving to Russia from abroad. In order to do it right (and legally), you will need to take care of a few registration processes when you arrive. Skoltech’s International Student Support team will help you with that. 

What you should have done before traveling to Russia:

1. Receive a student invitation visa letter from Skoltech  
2. Apply for a student visa to Russia in your home country  
3. Obtain a single-entry visa for 3 months  
4. Enter Russia at least 2 months before this visa expires

When you arrive: 

1. Within 7 working days of arrival (30 for students from CIS countries) you have to get a registration slip that confirms your residential address in Russia (more info will follow)

 

2. 40 days before your single-entry visa expires, Skoltech will help you change it to a multiple-entry visa and extend it for 1 year:  
* We suggest starting the process as soon as you arrive in Moscow to give yourself a running start  
* The Skoltech Migration will file all the paperwork for you this year and the next year (yes, the visa will be renewed again next September)  
* You need to provide all the original migration documents (passport with visa, migration card and registration for the process to the Migration Office at least 40 days before your single-entry visa expires. Bring them with you\!   
* During this process, you may not leave the country  
* If the purpose of your stay changes (i.e. if you choose to stop your studies or get a job), you will need to leave the country and get a new visa in your home country.

 

3. Within 90 days of arrival, you will need to pass a mandatory registration for incoming international citizens.  
* You will need to submit your fingerprint scans and a photo at a special registration center  
* The costs will be reimbursed to you in your scholarship  
* Skoltech will inform you about the process, provide instructions and organize the trip together with other international students when you arrive.   
* Not required for international students who have permanent residency (if you arrived via a single-entry visa, you don’t have it and will need to participate in the registration).

 

When you begin living in Moscow:

You will need to carry several documents with you to prove your stay in the country is legal. 

Russian Visa: gives you a legal approval for staying in Russia and studying here

* Either the single-entry visa you arrive with or the multiple-entry visa you will receive via Skoltech.   
* Located in your passport, so naturally you will need to carry your passport with you at all times:)

 

Migration Card: confirms the fact and purpose of your arrival in Russia

* you will be given one at the airport customs as soon as you arrive.  
* Your purpose of travel should state “Education”  
* The arrival date must have an official stamp on it  
* Russian spelling of your name should be the same as in your visa  
* You must provide a scan copy of this card to migrationDOCS@skoltech.ru ASAP. 

Registration Slip: confirms your address of stay with the exact dates of arrival and departure 

* Given to you by the dormitory manager or the hotel where you are staying automatically   
* If you choose to rent an apartment independently, you *and your landlord* will need to:  
  * Request a Letter of Enrollment from the Student Department using Helpdesk \- [Request official proof of enrollment for the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/28/create/287) . Then go to the Multifunctional Center or Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) office in your district in Moscow together with your landlord   
  * file a request for a Registration slip there

 

You must receive the registration slip within 

* 1 business day of your arrival at the most if you stay at the dorms  
  * 7 business days (30 for student from CIS countries) if you rent an apartment on your own. 

You will need to get a new registration slip every time you travel, even within Russia\!

If you travel or change your accommodation, please inform the Skoltech Migration Office [via HelpDesk](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/28/create/300?q=migration\&q\_time=1655721012395) 

You must also provide a scan copy of the registration slip to the Skoltech Migration specialist ASAP

If you end up in a hospital (we hope not\!), the hospital should provide you with a new registration slip as well. Remember to inform the Student Department if you are taken to the hospital.

That’s a lot of information and documents, we know. We also know that life situations change and you will likely have questions on what to do if your documents get updates.

  Your [checklist](https://box.skoltech.ru/index.php/s/UTK7tXDvLLSfYV5) of what to do if anything changes in your status, location or documents:

Let’s talk about traveling to Russia and abroad. 

*Text Overlay: Traveling in and out of Russia*

Russia is a huge and beautiful country with rich culture, history and people. Make sure to dedicate some time to exploring it and travel around it. The next section in this module will cover some key destinations and attractions, but right now let’s take care of the formalities.  
Вот Checklist before leaving Moscow:

- Please inform the Skoltech Migration Office and the Student Support Center at least 3 days in advance about your personal trips or change of accommodation. [Use Helpdesk.](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/28/create/300?q=migration\&q\_time=1655721012395)   
- We recommend choosing to stay in hotels vs. private apartments, since hotels will provide:  
  - Registration  
  - Information on COVID-19 restriction in this city/area  
  - Touristic support  
- Please send the photocopy of your new hotel registration slip to migrationDOCS@skoltech.ru 

*Text Overlay:* 

1)  *the Skoltech Migration Office and the Student Support Center*  
2) *stay in hotels:*   
   * *Registration*  
   * *Information on COVID-19 restriction in this city/area*  
   * *Touristic support*  
3) *photocopy of your new hotel registration* 

By the way, once you leave Moscow, your registration in Moscow stops and should be made again upon your return. So as you find new accommodation (both short- and long- term), make sure to fix a new registration fee and provide it to Skoltech).

If you’re going to travel outside the borders of the Russian Federation, your checklist will look a little different: 

- Write to migrationdocs@Skoltech.ru to check if there are any entrance restrictions with the country you are traveling to.  
- Buy flight tickets with a return date. However if you are going to buy a one-way ticket, check that there are available tickets to your coming back.

Now let’s take a look at Russia’s Culture Code. 

*Text Overlay: Russia’s Culture Code*

 Whether you are a seasoned traveler or not, learning about your destination’s culture, its people and history is a must. First of all, knowing some cultural habits will help you adapt easier (and avoid some awkward or offensive situations). Second, it’s simply a respectful thing to do. For example, you can’t assume that everyone speaks your native language or English and will adapt to your needs when you’re in a different country, right? :) Usually, it’s the other way around. This section will walk you through some interesting features of Russian culture. We’ll start with the language. 

*Инфографика: Language*

It’s the 8th most spoken language in the world with about 154 million native speakers. It uses the Cyrillic alphabet. Learn some letters before you travel . Middle names and nouns have genders. Russian is the language of space. International astronauts have to learn both English and Russian to do their space-related work. Skoltech has a Russian club where you can master the basics and a little more\! Another important part of language here is proverbs. People use them a lot here when the situation arises. The trick to understanding them is you can never translate them literally. You can find the Cyrillic alphabet and a site with Russian idioms in the description.

Now onto food. 

*Text Overlay: Food*

Most of the traditional dishes are eaten hot. Think of borsch, the red soup, and pelmeni \- traditional dumplings. Most dishes are accompanied with rye bread. Traditionally and historically, Russians welcomed dear guests with a loaf of bread and salt. It’s still done at some weddings. The most popular drink is not vodka, it’s tea\! Learn the most popular Russian dishes and make sure to try them during your stay here.

Speaking of Hosting Culture, here’s what you need to know. 

*Text Overlay:  Hosting Culture*

If you have been invited by somebody in Russia, you should not say no to the food offered by the host. You should respectfully accept the food offered because refusal to eat is considered offensive (at the same time, don’t eat it at all if you don’t want to, of course :) . Also, you must bring something as a gift for the host because coming without anything is considered bad here.

Holidays are a big part of Russian culture. Not only are they a reason to gather together with family and friends, but most of them also carry symbolic (and even patriotic) meaning related to history.

*Text Overlay: Holidays and festivities*

Russians respect religious holidays, but their favorite one is the non-religious New Year’s Eve. The second most popular holiday is again, not a religious one, but Victory Day. 

Here are the main official holidays:   
1 \- 10 January — New Year Holidays;  
7 January — Christmas, Russian Orthodox;  
23 February — Defender of Motherland Day;  
8 March — International Women’s Day;  
1 May — Spring and Labor Day;  
9 May — Victory Day (Over German Nazism in the WW2);  
12 June — Day of Russia;  
4 November — Day of the National Unity.

*Text Overlay::*   
*1 \- 10 January — New Year Holidays;*  
*7 January — Christmas, Russian Orthodox;*  
*23 February — Defender of Motherland Day;*  
*8 March — International Women’s Day;*  
*1 May — Spring and Labor Day;*  
*9 May — Victory Day (Over German Nazism in the WW2);*  
*12 June — Day of Russia;*  
*4 November — Day of the National Unity.*

Your academic (or professional) calendar will most likely revolve around these key holidays. If a holiday falls on a weekend, the following Monday is generally a day off as well. However, keep an eye on your academic calendar and announcements to get the most current information regarding days off.

People of all religions and nationalities are respected and welcome in Russia. You may find multiple options for religious congregations around the city and use the Multi Faith Prayer and Meditation room on the Skoltech campus any time.

*Text Overlay: Ethnic and religious diversity*

Others may refer to the idea and symbolism of a shared Russian ‘soul’ (dusha). This explains the soul as the combination of one’s heart, mind and culture, and the uniting point making Russians a cohesive ‘people’ (narod) despite their differences.

### Russians tend to have big families and stay in touch not only with immediate but also with distant family members. All important decisions are made by the whole family. Additionally, close friends are regarded as family. For many Russians, the interests of a family and a group prevail over the ones of one person. If you see a group of Russian students in a lecture, you will notice that the majority of them are reluctant to speak up or ask questions. All the disputes are held one-to-one as all the members of the group should have a common opinion.

Moving on to Navigating Moscow and Russia. We’ll cover the main points in the video, and if you want more detailed information, you can find it in the description. 

*Text Overlay: Navigating the city of Moscow*

Yandex Maps are your best friend for navigating the city. You can plan your routes, see bus schedules (and moving buses), read and leavelocation reviews and more. This service is best adapted to the streets of Moscow and Russia. Download the app and use it when you need to.

*Graphic: Yandex Maps icon* 

Moscow’s public transportation system is extremely well-developed. 

*Text Overlay: Public transportation*

The buses, metro, trains and other city-sponsored modes of transfer are integrated by one system. You can buy yourself single- or double-ride tickets or get a permanent Troika card and top off its balance every once in a while. If you’re planning to explore the city center, we recommend using the underground metro. Yandex Metro app (links to an external site)has the current map and allows you to plan your route to point A to point B. The metro is designed in a sun-like way, with multi-colored lines stemming away from the center outwards. There are also several circle lines which connect them. You will notice on the map (and have already seen it mentioned in this course) the MCD lines. These are newer extensions of the metro line that take you a little bit outside of the city for a few extra rubles. One of these lines, MCD 1, takes you almost directly to Skoltech and is the best way to get to campus from the city center. If you use the metro app to plan your route, select the stop called “Skolkovo” and it will calculate your route for you. Easy, huh\! If you live or end up far away from a metro station, you can take the bus, a tramway or a small overground shuttle (aka marshrutka). The Yandex Transport app shows you the nearest stops, when the next bus, tram or shuttle will arrive there and where it can take you. You can also plan your route there.

*Graphic: Yandex Transport icon*

Finally, if you are in a huge rush, feel free to catch a taxi. Watch out if you’re traveling to the campus, as not all services have automatic access to the Skolkovo Territory. Here’s a quick list of apps you can use: яндекс такси, ситимобил, убер. 

*Graphic: Yandex Taxi, Citimobil, Uber icons.* 

Oh, almost forgot\! When it gets warmer, you can rent electric scooters and bikes all around the city (and even in the Skolkovo Territory). If you see a little parking lot with scooters or bikes, look for a QR code to download its app and reserve yourself a machine. The system will tell you how long you have rented it for, its charge (if it’s electric) and the nearest parking location. Just watch out for those puddles\!

Moving on to grocery shopping. 

*Text Overlay: Grocery shopping*

Show us a person who doesn’t love food. Anyone? Anyone? Thought so. Shopping for groceries and basic necessities is pretty easy in Moscow. If you live in an apartment building, chances are there will be a chain grocery store somewhere within your walking distance (use Yandex Maps to find one\!). Some popular grocery shops to look for are: Magnit   
Pyaterochka Vkusvill Perekrestok Magnolia Auchan Lenta Metro

*Text Overlay:* 

* *Magnit (Магнит)*  
* *Pyaterochka (Пятерочка)*  
* *Vkusvill (Вкусвилл)*   
* *Perekrestok (Перекресток)*  
* *Magnolia (Магнолия)*  
* *Auchan (a huge one)*  
* *Lenta (also a big store)*  
* *Metro (enormous\!)* 

Moreover, you can also order a delivery to your home if you feel lazy or live far away from the grocery stores. Some popular apps to quickly order food from are: Cбермаркет, Яндекс Лавка, Самокат. You can find links to these in the description. 

You can also visit the official websites of the chain stores listed above and order directly from them.

You’ve already seen some information on the mobile service in the Accommodation section. If you need to get a new cell phone service to use it while in Russia, you can visit one of the phone companies below and get a Russian phone number, an internet plan and more. You’ll need your passport to make this happen. The most popular and reliable cell service providers are: 

- [MTS](https://www.mts.ru/)  
- [Beeline](https://moskva.beeline.ru/customers/products/)  
- [Megafon](https://www.megafon.ru/)  
- [Tele](https://msk.tele2.ru/)

You can use the [Yandex Maps app](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/maps/) to find the closest mobile service provider’s office to you.

Luckily you guys will have your own healthcare plans. You may also find apothecaries (apteka/аптека) all around the city to get basic medicine or fill a prescription from your doctor. You can use the Yandex Maps app to find the closest apteka to you.

Ah, the fun stuff\! Unless you think finding groceries is fun, too. Then we won’t judge. The city of Moscow and the entire country have loads of places to explore. From historic locations to restaurants and museums, you’ll find something to your liking here. There is always something going on: concerts, festivals, markets and more. And the nightlife…well, it’s another city that never sleeps\! The article below has the best resources for getting to know Moscow. 

And the last question for this course \- Further Residing in Russia

*Text Overlay:  Further Residing in Russia*

So you want to stay in Russia after graduation? That’s a long time away, so let’s do a quick overview of how you can make it possible when you are ready. 

You will be legally required to leave the country within 3 days of graduation, even if your visa doesn’t expire for a while. The reason for that is your purpose of stay will change \- you will no longer be a student :(

If you wish to return for any reason \- like if you get a job offer or simply want to relax here for a few months \- you will need to go to your home country and get a new visa that aligns with your new purpose of stay. 

If you do not need a visa to enter Russia (if you’re from a CIS country, for example), you will still need to leave and return, indicating a new purpose of stay at the customs. 

However, Skoltech can help you stay in Russia for a few extra weeks after graduation. You can file a request for a vacation via the Education Office and get a quick extension to wrap up your travels and check some items off your bucket list ;)  

This information will be communicated to you closer to your graduation, so you don’t need to think about it too hard right now. Instead, focus on the time and experience you will be getting at Skoltech as a student starting September. Now that will be a time to remember\! 

Good luck and see you here soon\!
